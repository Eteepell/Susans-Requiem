outside of spelling the way daemon is addressed
helps differentiate the traditional malevolent 
demon And the benign daemon.

pronunciation of daemon could be demon or daimon
using daimon is the Greek for divine power which
is more than appropriate and helps keep daemon 
as a distinct entity.

demons are addressed individually or as a group
summon a demon
raise a demon
raise demons
I am a demon
that is a demon

daemon is addressed as one... one daemon many persons/energies
a tip of the hat to "we are legion" and "I am" of
old testament. signifier of the might of daemon. 
summon daemon
raise daemon
we are daemon
I am daemon

judeochristian faith is right hand path focused
on forsaking the world to attain a righteous after
life. Daemon is creation. Daemon is the world.
ergo daemon is the adversary of judeochristian faith
and is left hand path being indulgence to release
worldly desires by becoming tired of them. this
signifies one view of the susanverse and the "demonizing"
of daemon. the path of daemon and of the church are
polar driving on opposite sides of the road to the hereafter.

the susanverse is a multiverse. Daemon exists in the
"oververse" which means they are one and the same in
all universes fully omnipotent and aware of the whole
multiverse constantly. daemon may be the only resident
of the oververse and the only true omnipotent being
in the multiverse save for the holy trinity. Susan herself is of course
not in touch with the greatness within herself but
it is there and she will over a long time grow into
her own bigass shoes.
