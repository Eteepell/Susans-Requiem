\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{L}ate Sunday afternoon a preacher from a neighbouring village came for a visit to find me. I was having dinner with Jose, Francisca and kids when a knock came at the door. The man said Father Antonio sent him over, his village is being terrorized by a supernatural entity. William was the preacher's name, a fundamentalist protestant missionary. You know the type, the ``if it ain't Jesus it be the devil'' sort. Its good he didn't know about my, umm, features. It made me chuckle nonetheless. Especially when I made the head tilted down in shyness act (to hide the fangs). He said he came here because it is becoming well known that I have great knowledge of vampirism and the supernatural. Well I should imagine.

William states, ``Hello Susan, I have a bit of a problem.''

I roll my eyes, really, can you start much more vague? ``I have a few, wanna trade?''

``Not presently. I am, well our town is, experiencing what might seem to be vampiric activity although we haven't seen the creature. Even when it seems to be feeding.''

Hells bells, right over his head. I know it's dry humor but still he should have acknowledged. Oh well. Vampires unseen when feeding? That's new. As a matter of fact this creature seems to be completely new to me. Very cool, I'm in.

I pushed my chair back and stood straight up. Jose looked at me, he hadn't seen this side of me yet, the relentless journalist.

``Where?''

``Well really in the town nowhere specific, particularily around the town cemetary. Some have been sleeping in shifts to ward off the creature but every night a resident is either pale from blood loss or dead. Even when someone was standing guard all night. Sometimes more than one person some residents have gathered into each others homes for safety but it has been quite futile.''

Oh crap, this is creepy. I'm going to need to gather some more intel from this guy and follow up with some research. I don't want to become the next bloodless cadaver. Well, present symptoms aside.

``Come, have some dinner. We have plenty especially for someone so troubled.'' Francisca says.

``Thank you good woman, I certainly will. Will you help us out?'' petitions William.

``Oh I'm all over it like a cheap suit dude, when we finish dinner if it's ok with you we will head to my odd little abode and makeshift office. Jose and Carlos will be with us, they rarely leave my side. It's been hard for me to adjust to life after the war, I'm sure you understand. They are sworn to secrecy though so don't worry about sensitive details do tell everything you know. Anything could be an important clue in this matter.''

``And thank you Susan we will certainly bring to light the facts on the matter.''

And so it began. According to William the events started 3 months ago. ``We all knew about vampires and stood on guard for them but we haven't seen any as I mentioned. Not even a sound. Those who have had garlic or onions in the home seem to be the least effected. Miguel and his family have also been less effected but the only thing new for him was he was sewing seeds for his garden recently. It makes no sense. Yet none of it does. Jorge and his family have been the most effected. He has a large family but he has lost 3 members of his family so far and they have yet to see their attacker.''

William continued with his testimony. Right, OK. Definately seems to be a vampire. Onions are new though, that might help. A garden? That really might be nothing I've never in my life heard anything remotely caustic about a newly sewed garden with respect to vampires. In my change I've never had any repulsion of gardens newly sewn or not. That is something that may be a huge clue. Or it may be a waste of time. I'm leaning toward it being a waste of time. Looks like it's time to hit the books.

``Thank you William, I am going to retire to my study to research things further. Please allow my companions to offer any hospitality to you as our meager means allows. I will see you soon at you house. Give me a week or two.''

``Thank you Susan, this means the world to me and my town. I'll wait with bated breath.''

God was that ever creepy. That whole ``Please allow my companions'' thing just seems so Bela Lugosi. Next I'll be calling for Renfield. Shit. I feel like wallpapering my tower with disney characters now. Well, actually no. Maybe kinda. No that would be just exchanging one kind of creepy for another so no.

Oh for a computer and an internet connection. I have a pretty good library in the basement especially on vampirism but it doesn't matter how many books anyone can accumulate the internet is just so much better. Oh, and for what it's worth my basement is actually an unoccupied part of the crypt. The three of us walled off the crypt and boarded over it to create a safe space. Otherwise, hells bells, that would be the ultimate in creepy. With what's left of my ailment I really don't need the burden of that reality.

Nonetheless, given my limited resources I was still able to find some hits starting from the middle ages. Starting and going back in time. The further back I go it seems the more occurances that meet Williams description I could find. I'm finding the greatest amount in the time of Sumer but that's as far back as my resources can reach. Hells bells this is getting awesome. Have I found the forefather of all vampires? My research indicates I may have. I have no magical references though just historical. In order to solve this I think I'm going to have to move forward by going to this poor town and doing some footwork to find out what I can dig up. Perhaps if nothing else I can get enough to know where to further my research.

I contact William by phone. Which by the way since the telco charges even to just pick the phone up conversations are rather brief. That's a gripe for another day though. He is allowing me to stay with him for the time I am there. Great. Like a week of not smiling. Speaking of which my companions did the most terrible task of feeding me before I left so I didn't end up looking like the walking dead. So yeah after I calmed down I did some sunbathing on the battlements to wash that horror off me. I'll never be at peace with such a thing.

Vehicles in this part of the world seem no better than Harry's beetle, I'm surprised some of them have a wiring harness. I've seen some vehicles that go back to the 50's. Roads are no better. We get there in one piece except that my ass is flat from the combination of the bad roads and old vehicle making like a jackhammer to my bottom. I met William again and he invited me in. I seen he had a backporch so we retired there for a good lunch and to enjoy a little sun.

That afternoon we explored. First the cemetary since the phenomenon seemed to focus around this area. 

I inquire, ``Is this an active cemetary, I mean are there fresh burials?'' 

``No not for some time. There are still some empty plots but they were purchased a century ago. The purchase certificates are presumed lost over time but the town council will not resell the plots out of a sense of common decency.'' 

``Yeah I can just imagine, I'm sorry but someone outbid you on your plot, gramma is going to have to get a cremation.''

OK so an inactive graveyard. Further exploration brings up nothing.

We continue over to Jorge's home. When we enter there are a most disturbing number of crosses on the walls and in every part of the house. Wallpapered with crosses. I was invited in so that worked out fine but all these crosses are making me itchy all over. I'm going to be itching for days I'm thinking. I talk to Jorge and he says the vampire has been attacking them ever since their father died. He thinks there might have been foul play and the Lord is punishing them for someone's secret shame. They pray every day but the horror keeps happening. I'm thinking to myself buddy, if the crosses aren't working maybe you should try something different and not keep pounding a dead horse. I wouldn't say it though.

We went to Miguel's next. The first thing I noticed is that he not only seeded the garden but seeded the entire threshold. The seedbag had a hole perhaps. This may be significant as I know well the threshold of a house can bar a supernatural creature from entry. I query Miguel.

``Miguel has anyone been attacked in your household?'' I know the answer is yes, just wondering what his answer will be.

``Yeah, little Jimmy was looking pretty pale a month ago. Assuming it wasn't a medical issue it must have been the vampire. Our two youngest girls also. Same condition. Nothing since.''

``Miguel when did you seed your garden?''

''It was perhaps about 4 weeks ago''

Oh yeah, score one. Need to look up supernatural occurrances related to seeding. Of course need to check for scientific explanations and consider the fact the children did not die but were affected in such a mild way the odds are in favour of a scientific explanation. Or better said to be a medical one.

``Is there anything else, out of the ordinary, you may have noticed in town.''

``Yeah, I've seen a shaman in the streets at night. It's an odd thing, we don't have a shaman in this town we all are God fearing christians. I've seen him around a couple months now.''

uh huh, score is 2 now. Look for magick, particularily rituals, that bring about this kind of thing. Oh yeah smokin'.

``William, Jorges father or father in law I didn't catch it, was he an odd sort?''

``Oh very much so. He read into musty old books and loved chemistry of all things. He called it alchemy but whatever. Some kind of history nut I guess.''

``If Jorge is able could you spare me some of those old dusty tomes and some equipment, It might be important.''
``Absolutely, nobody around here has any interest in the stuff. Would probably just end up in the garbage.''

``Well in that case you can give me the lot of it and I'll sort through it.''

``Sure, if you really want it, it's yours. Just happy to get it out of the way, Thanks Susan.''

``No problem.''

Looking good so far. The rest of the search turned up nothing so I spent the night and headed back the next day heavy some books and lab equipment.

Back home I spent a week looking through my own library to no avail. The musty tomes have yet to reveal anything, some are ancient egyptian others are a language I have no previous knowledge of. I either need a computer with internet or access to a library, preferably at a university. As a matter of fact access to an archeology professor would be most excellent. I hope this article turns heads and scores me some cash I seriously need to expand my library and setup a lab. Well and a computer with internet. The computer with internet first I would say.

During my meditation that night I had a vision of laying on the alter at Chich\'{e}n Itz\'{a}, my blood pooling around me. The sound of thunder and a million points of light, turning into a million bolts of lightning striking me a tearing me inside out. Then I wake on the alter just like I did the day I started my journey back here, with all the combatants having vanished into the wind. I don't remember anything about thunder and lightning in my recollection of events so I assume it is my version of a bad dream. Some time after the vision I heard a multi-voice like from a B movie demon, ``join ussss''. Sorry buddy or buddies whatever not joining your party but thanks.

I ask Jose if there is anybody nearby with a computer and internet. He said yeah there's a mathematics professor north of here. He works in San Jose but keeps a cabin down here for private time. It's 8 hours walk or less to drive. I thought duh then thought, yeah with the condition of the roads and cars down here sometimes it is a tossup which way is faster.

I decided to do the car thing. It didn't take too long so I'm glad it was advantagous. The professor's name is Philip and he keeps his spare key under the doormat. Well fuck almighty nobody would think to look there. I suppose that's why they say ``absent minded professor''.

So the computer and internet are working 365 days a year. Well maybe not working but definately contracted to 365 day service. As I expected being a math prof, he's running off a unix style computer. Debian linux in fact. Doesn't matter first thing I do is burn tails on a CD and reboot. I don't know if I've said this before but this is one of those things hard core journalists learn quickly to keep their ass covered. Good, now I have internet access.

Got some of the books with me I snap some pictures and send it with gpg encrypted email to an archeologist contact at ucla. I've known him for a while. A long while. We only meet at certain conventions though. He wouldn't know if I was dead or alive otherwise, and thank God for that. He'll get back to me within the week so I'll come back then. Back to town then the women are putting together a bake sale and I'm gonna help out. Then resume my studies on vampirism to try to find salvation.

Sure enough I called Philip 3 days later and he let me know he repied. He wouldn't say any more of course otherwise what's the point in corresponding with gpg encrypted E-Mails? Well I head back to the cabin with Jose and found out the news.

The sample I transmitted to him was a language called enochian, and the other was as I thought ancient egyptian. Actually middle egyptian but same diff. Anyway in addition to that the egyptian work seemed to relate to something called an etheric revenant whatever that is. He said it was a historic document. The enochian portion was apparently hard to decipher because the language was supposedly revealed by the angelic and is not complete. He did determine that it was a magickal ritual though so at least there's that.

Cool. Now we're getting somewhere. Need to find out what the hell an etheric revenant is, and see how much I can decipher of this enochian document. I found some translation guidelines on the internet just now for enochian and it looks easy enough, I'll see how much I can put together. It sounds like the guy likely needed to use multiple sources to put the ritual together just based on the incompleteness of the enochian language. I'm gonna have some fun with that, oh yeah. For the ancient egyptian tomes I am pleased to say there were not many. I scanned them, gpg encrypted them, then shared them off to my guy at ucla. For what it's worth his name is Keith. I gave him a ring and he said 3 days. He's going to throw it through his OCR software and clean up what's left after to speed things along.

So it took four or five days and I got the enochian books translated. He's right what a mess. It seems to translate only half of the everyday vocabulary. I'm prejudiced though because I did take four to five days deciphering the mess. It is definately is a ritual and the tomes altogether showed a ritual that seems to show methods of strengthening the ethereal body to hold the spirit from passing through the veil. I have no idea what ethereal means yet but I know the veil reference is the gateway to the afterlife, the expressway to the far reaches of the nevernever which is heaven, hell, tarterus and such. Learned that on other articles. OK looks like we got more than a bite out of that apple I'll bet it's halfway devoured. Now just to wait on the egyptian translation and I think we can fix this crap once and for all. I'm sure glad I got the big pile of ``junk'' from William, or Jorge as it were.

One thing I'm sure of is that this is definately a vampire. Maybe not the sort we're seeing in modern times. I wonder if this thing might be the forefather of all the vampire courts somehow, it seems so alien and ancient in nature. These tomes seem to be middle age or dark age, very old. The egyptian works are far older, I don't know how old middle egyptian is but it sounds very old. Speaking of which I recieved his transmission, printed and bound it for reading when I get back to my cozy little stone tower.

What do we got here. OK so it looks like the ethereal is a plane of existence, perhaps referring to the edge of the nevernever like to the skin on top of water. It refers to the human person as being the only creature to exist on all the planes of existence making us special. Well don't I feel special. We have an ethereal body which attaches our physical to the spiritual or non-physical components of our whole self, and the ethereal and physical body feed and maintain each other. Everything we consume has physical and ethereal properties and our physical body has a part in metabolizing ethereal energy, balancing intake in conjunction with the ethereal as well as acting as a kind of ``battery'' to help manage our ethereal balance. OK so if we die, as in our physical self dies, we then undergo a ``second death'' where that interdependant relationship causes the ethereal body to die also and both bodies break down releasing to spirit into the nevernever like a helium balloon destined for the farthest reaches where the pantheistic afterlife exists.

The etheric revenant is an ethereal body that has not died the way the physical has. A magickal ritual is used, which is not detailed here, to prevent that second death. Depending on the condition of the physical body the revenant will need to to feed more, or feed less. Feeding the etheric energies of the physical around them other people are the best source of etheric energy. When the revenant feeds although not physically connected to the physical body there is still an etheric connection but anyway the physical body although dead still benefits and deterioration of that physical body is slowed to stopped. The black court should take some lessons here because they clearly are doing something wrong. Anyway according to this the ritual preserves the body in such a prestine condition that the caretakers (or companions in a sense) only had to feed physical human meals to the creature for sustenance as the physical body had nearly the full interdependant capacity as it did in life.

Oh Christ, there it is clear as day! This is the signpost showing the direction to salvation! It is not any kind of cure yet but what I see here directs me to not research a cure for the physical reality of the vampire but rather heal it's ability to eat physical food like a human does. Ah crap I think we've been going at it wrong all this time because we didn't have this ancient knowledge. 

Did I ever scream when I seen that, for someone that has lost all hope even that little possibility mean everything in the world! Jose came running and I explained what I seen. I recieved a long hug and ever rugged Jose actually shed tears. He does care about me after all, we are comrades from the war and as any vets know there is a special relationship between fellow soldiers.

So I believe we have what we need. We should seek out that wandering shaman because I suspect he is intimately involved in this. As a matter of fact I would say he is the magician (term used in magickal arts. stage magicians are referred to as illusionists) who performed the ritual to bring about the etheric revenant in the first place. I'm sure he has protected himself effectively as most times this ritual is an evil thing to achieve immortality. Also since he performed the ritual he would know where he placed the body so we can go there to destroy the body causing the second death and releasing the spirit. Beautiful. This article is going to seriously rock.
