	\textit{My name is Jose, and I would like to tell the story of a hero of our town.}
\end{center}		
It started during the dark days of a war we know little about. We don't know why the vampires had risen in such numbers. They terrorized us, fed on us, killed us. No one was safe they fed on men, women, and children there was no escape.

The ones we called the cursed, they called themselves the fellowship, fought with us to drive back the horde. They were ones whom the vampires had partially turned but fought back and refused to fully become a vampire. As long as they refuse they remain human with limited supernatural powers. We couldn't win but we pulled our children out and sent them north out of the grips of the hungry vipers. That we did. Every once in a while one of the cursed would fall prey to the bloodlust and change, whether it was us or even others in the fellowship we would destroy them before we lost the chance as once they've changed they wont go back.

The horrors of that time are still with us, for some or perhaps many of us our dreams will be haunted the rest of our days.

It was like a dream, one day these demons fell. All of them, all at once they were gone, like they were nothing but a phantasm from the start. For a few months many of the villagers were very sick in longing for the hosts with some dark unholy desire. They were free over the passage of time. Our lives returned to some sense of normalcy although there are wounds that can never heal, curses and scars of mind and body that should not be in the light of day.

After the passing of months coming up from the valley a familiar face came by the light of high noon. Is this the last of the fellowship? Maybe she would know? One of our towns heros, Susan, has returned. What was done to her? Her tattoo is gone. Her clothes torn encrusted with blood and the salt of tears she couldn't speak but it was clear our hero came to us for help. By Christ we will give it.

We cleaned her up, placed her in fresh clothes. She was shaking, and could not say a word. That night some townspeople took shifts. We had placed her in bed but she rose and sat cross legged on the bed human eyes staring out into the night. Face of terror and eyes all tears she rocked back and forth there.

The next morning she had breakfast and rested, but by noon was out in the fields helping bring in the harvest. She knew us and our lives, I was happy she had a chance to meet the people she knew once again. She settled in for a meal at our families home and I asked her how long she was going to stay. She said she likely won't leave unless she had to. I asked her if she was better she replied no. The thirst is still with me. I was very sad the monsters did not take that with them. I said to her the evil is gone now what happens now? Can you still fall? She said she isn't sure of anything anymore. I left it at that.

The next day was Sunday and she somewhat reluctantly went with us to mass. She was awfully scared but nothing there seemed to bother her. The holy items made her tingle, maybe itch she said. She put a finger in holy water and it blistered and itched for a week like poison ivy. Well I guess I'm getting better, she said, maybe it's only a matter of time before my life begins again.

There was not a single night that dear Susan slept, she just sat there. After a few days she began meditating at night instead of attempting to sleep. She said it at least make me feel like I might have slept. I feared if she doesn't get a proper rest she will go mad.

A couple weeks later she was helping our innkeeper remove garbage one evening and came a crash. The patrons including me ran out to the alley and found Susan there on the ground feeding on Miguel. We knew the drill, grab something for a weapon she is going to launch at us with a hiss of arrogance. She was kneeling on the ground shaking not unlike the day she came to us. She was saying something like, ``it shouldn't be me, I'm here but why am I here it should not be me. That which is not me was meant to be me as I am I should not be.' She turns to me blood dripping from her jaw. `how do I go back? This that I am I am not, it is me! Not me! Lay down the weapons I am me should you kill me I will be not me but I will still be as not me.''

We looked at each other and drew the same conclusion. She is no vampire she has gone completely mad. We need to clean her up and restrain her for her own safety.To hell with Miguel he was a collaborator with the vampires, if she didn't spill his blood I'm sure someone else would have.

We brought in the priest and healers the next day. There was a general conclusion that if she didn't get sleep soon all she will ever know are restraints. The priest asked for volunteers to act as companions for her to help her sleep and heal. Me and Carlos volunteered. Unofficially we became the first companions. Meaning being one of Susan's ``companions'' became a rather important vocation in this town.

When the others left we explained that we will be staying with her to look after her continually, we looked at each other, and said presumably in shifts I guess. She stared. I ask, 

``OK then, so are you still thirsty Susan? ''.  

``Better since last night'' she said to me. 

Uh oh, so there was something real about last nights event. OK let's think, so she isn't hiding the fact, which if I were a vampire I would do. She put it right out there like she was saying my coffee is cold. OK so what does she know? 

``Susan, did you actually drink last night?'' 

``I've been compelled to feed a number of times since the day I awoke Jose.'' 

``that should mean you're so much a vampire bats are flying out your...''. 

``I know, I know. Here I am though. As far as I know it's me. Like fully intact Susan and I don't understand it. Something must have happened when the red court died but I feel fairly human. I went to the parish with you and nothing bothered me unless you call an annoying rash a reaction which could have just been something in the water.''

``You're killing?''

``Martin, he was the first. Then Miguel, but he tried to assault me. Others just enough to live by. Noone else died it's just like I needed a meal like any other person. I just wanna switch to chicken instead, OK? It's traumatizing Jose I just want it to stop. I swear to all that's holy I'm still Susan stuck in what sometimes seems like a foreign body and doing something no living human was ever meant to do. What am I? If I'm not a vampire and not human then what, a frog?''

``No I think the prince is the frog. So literally real numbers how often?''

``Well I guess, it's been 2 months I think? Not including casualties I've had a dozen feedings all totalled maybe a pint but why?.Oooo no hell no! No you're not no way not happening bud! Think of something else some 'i cant believe its not blood' sports drink or make my steaks extra rare whatever OK? I've seen that with other vampires keeping a meal close but I'm no vampire, I don't know what the hell I am but I ain't like that...''

I dropped the topic. After Susan peeled herself off the ceiling (figuratively) the three of us went out to the field to help in the harvest. We washed up on returning and had a good meal. The other workers at the table jumped 3 feet every time Susan made a quick move. I actually found it quite amusing. I heard a little bit of ``she's mad you know?''. Well perhaps I thought. Hopefully.

The next couple weeks went fine. I mean Susan still didn't sleep, I'm getting used to that now. I presume now it is just some fellowship curse or something. I hope it goes away. I spent some time talking to Susan about what happened before she got here.

``I'm missing quite a bit but the last moment I remember was killing Martin then I woke up laying in a graveyard. At my grave. Dated this year. Yeah, I missed quite a bit.''

``Ah. Any reason for killing Martin?''

``Seriously Jose?''

``Not what I meant. I mean what was going on?''

``I remember the red court had something planned, a sacrifice. Harry was there. There was something we had to do to stop the vampires. I was asking him to kill me but I don't know why, ...''

``I guess he did then.''

``I guess so. What an asshole.'', Susan rolls her eyes, ``I'll have to get more of my memory back to get more sense of it.''

``Understandable, Susan you are looking a little gaunt''.

``Thirsty.''

``uh, oh? Umm? You gonna be OK? Need to cool down?''

``I'll be OK. Tell you what, if I get not OK I'll let you know?''

``Okey dokey.''

\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{H}i, I'm susan. This is the life I started after I cheated death.\\

I talked to father Antonio and he gave me use of the old basilica. It had burnt down years ago but was built at a time when things had to be made defensible. Much of it was uninhabitable but two things in particular were in good shape. The four story stone tower complete with battlements. It's not big inside that tower but sufficient for me. There was also the basement to the main church structure. Most of it held crypts but there was some space a little less creepy.

\end{wrapfigure}
Me and my companions moved into the tower and we made it nice. Jose and Francisca had me over for every meal and I enjoy playing with the children. I never used to be big with children but since I've been back here I've feeling a need for children. I think about my baby girl and hope to see her soon. I find it rather odd and yet comforting as the desire to procreate is so human.

In another couple weeks my companions had to confront me as apparently I was getting rather cadaverous looking. They gave me the ultimatum that either I needed to find a way to feed or I would have to stay in the tower permanently as the townsfolk were beginning to presume an evil about me. I was surprised even as deathly as I apparently looked I had no desire to feed anymore. After a while they wore me down though. I couldn't bear being stuck alone in the tower. In the end They fed me their own blood I absolutely refused to actively feed on them. Actually, it was only Marcos that gave blood. His doctor was going to leach him anyway due to some ailment. Two birds with one stone I guess. It was traumatic for me anyway. They cleaned everything up immediately and had to stay near me for a long time to comfort me. I shed tears over this, it's incomprehensible to imagine I'm a full red court vampire after all I've been through. The hunger is gone now though so I can't be. No way. I can only presume time will heal and the rest can be resolved through research.

Life continued, I "fed" if you could call it that every 2 weeks approximately and my companions and me kept strict confidence with each other with everything. As corny as it sounds ``whatever happens at the tower, stays at the tower.'' I learned more about me and so did my companions as time went on.

One of the first things I asked of my companions was for regular shipments of magical and historical references. I wanted to research myself and know more to find ways to resolve the remaining vampire characteristics.

I need to get a publisher for my articles again. I can't use the Midwestern Arcane anymore, I departed from them and I'm pretty sure the being dead thing would tend to make them refute I am actually the one applying for a position. As a matter of fact I'm not sure how my resume could be validated for exactly the same reason. I have some connections from the war perhaps I can burn tails on a cd and borrow their computers for anonymous submissions. Anonymous payments could be with bitcoin the Arcane is setup for that too. This could work. Writing with my style and knowledge they may eventually clue in. Good enough let's get going.
