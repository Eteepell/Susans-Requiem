\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{B}ack to the old tower I go up to the battlements to fire up the old BBQ. Got it going about 11PM and my fellas got themselves some fine burgers from me before heading to sleep in the towers spare rooms. Carlos at the very least sleeps light he will hear a knock on the door. I sit and go into meditation then rising to restart it and get some burgers on at about quarter to 3. So yes Jose does spend the odd night sleeping here, his family is getting to know me better now as time goes on. I'm getting to know the womenfolk better too and my baking skills are becoming passable at the parish functions. All good things.

My guests arrived but it wasn't through the front door. A thick mist came on to the battlements and one by one they emerged. The first was a gentleman with translucent hair and pure white eyes. Nothing else special about him just an ordinary bloke. He spoke and said that his name is Eurynomous. He introduced his two friends the first had a robe and cowl that made him look like the grim reaper minus the scythe. The robe covered every part of him. Eurynomous stated this gentleman's name is Balberith. The last gentleman to emerge, if you could call him a gentleman by appearance was named Babeal. He was semi-corporeal, with long flowing robes.

My guests and me sat down to some burgers. I was fascinated by the fact Babeal, as ghostly as he seemed, packed burgers down quite well without any falling right out of his ghostly form.

Afterwards we talked at length about the war. I came to find out they fought in the war also, in a humanitarian manner. They tended to the dead, comforted those who suffered loss, and were companions for the dead or dying. I was thankful they did that work the fellowship were often too concerned with fighting the battle than to take time to care for those suffering because of it. The stories these guys had were incredible. It made me ashamed to say I seen the most horrible things in the war as they seen so much worse.

They were quite open as to how it effected them which helped me open up a little about how it is for me. It helped, I've been so self-conscious about who and what I am. I'm just so scared about being like the reds since I know there is some of that monster still in me. They told me that's not entirely true though and we'll talk about it a little later.

We talked about the ancient magick for a long while. It just isn't the same, the mainstream wizardry today is based on the ``power of creation''. The same principles apply in general but ancient magick was (and is) based on ``power of will''. Mainstream wizardry is far more immediate, potent, and controllable. The ancient magick comes from the persons inherent divinity summoned forth through an act of will. The result is almost always unpredictable, indifferentiable from coincidence, and unrelated to effects stemming from the power of creation. The magick is entirely different. It also can be used where modern magick cannot be, such as to combat ancient monsters. Users of ancient magick are traditionally called magicians. Not to be confused with stage magicians who do illusions for entertainment, magicians who work with the ancient magic call these entertainers ``illusionists'' to differentiate themselves from the David Copperfields of the world. The word magick is also used to differentiate itself from both modern wizardry and stage magic. There are precious few practitioners of ancient magick in the world today but the art remains with us and will likely always remain with us as long as the human race continues. Or so I think anyway based on what I've heard.

One thing in the conversation that jumped out at me was ancient magick practitioners have no issues with anything electronic or electrical, so I could keep using computers to research and write stories. That's pretty big for me. I'm interested.

So they showed me How to cast a balancing circle that I can use when meditating. They showed me the ancient methods of magickal meditation and trance. I learned how to train in visualization and the use of sigils. And finally they gave me basic knowledge that is sufficient to allow me to find my own learning material to continue advancing in this most singular of mystical arts.

They went on to explain the nature of red court vampirism, or at least to the best of their ability. It did in fact stem from the idea of the etheric revenant. Practitioners of ancient magick in an evil bid to achieve ultimate power and immortality went beyond what I had seen in their atrocities and created the abominations that would be the vampire courts. By tapping into some manner of evil power once a court was born. It only needed to happen once and the spirit of evil that consumed the human victim would continue it's propogation for all time. It being now an entirely different and unnatural species, a creature not alive or of this world and yet at the same time somehow still a part of it.

Consider that the revenant is actually a natural part of the living human person. The ethereal body exists in the living and represents in a way the glue that binds the physical to the spiritual in the human person. That is a natural part of every person. That does not mean every person is part vampire. Yet that same part after the physical death, if that ethereal part of the person does not also die becomes the vampire of ancient legend. It is still part human but needs to feed somehow just like any human does.

The court vampire though is not human. It is the result of an ethereal body corrupted into becoming a cancer that consumes the whole physical and ethereal human person. So for the red the creature injects a human host with a spawn that consumes the ethereal body of the host and exists in it's place. This is the half-vampire stage. The human person, spirit and body, is still functioning and true to form but the ethereal vampire is still fully functional at this stage although hampered by it's physical and spiritual limitations. The more it's powers are accessed the more it needs to be fed from it's host to do so and the more hunger comes of it. You already know how that side works.

What you don't know is that the vampire needs that first blood kill in order for it to have the strength to complete the consumption of it's host. It consumes the entire physical body of it's host releasing the human soul into the hereafter. What seems to be the person after the fact is the vampire having taken to itself the memories and personality of it's former host which it does when it consumes the host. That essence of the former host provides the new born full court vampire with it's distinctiveness and sense of self. What may seem like some to be a corrupt or perhaps redeemable human person is truly not human at all and this is why. The human that once was is in the hereafter, and it is highly unlikely that human will be judged for the final feeding which is far beyond their control. At least generally, living as a half vampire is like a teenager in a car race down city streets, a crash is fairly inevitable.

``OK so far so good. Sounds like I've been half eaten. I guessed on that already but the hunger is disappeared so I fix that and what's the difference? I don't feel evil and I would think if I was somebody in this town would have called me up on it.''

They continue. ``You are much different than anything before Susan. The vampire was in the midst of it's consumption of you and if just a few moments longer your spirit would have been cast to the nevernever. The rite of ascension hit before you were released and the result is that the full force of a million full court vampire spirits infused their power to you upon their death. The feedback caused fusion rather than release. It hit your human soul head on with deifying power. The vampiric soul which would normally have consumed and taken for itself your former body was instead utterly destroyed and consumed by your existing human soul before it was able to depart. Snapped back in and fused by the new power of that human soul which in turn quickened every part of you. You are the first full court vampire in human history with a complete human soul, yet as a full court vampire you are still the last and greatest of your kind. In the nevernever you are called like by the tongue of the red king, ``The great mother''. 

As my eyes were nearly falling out of my sockets at this point I decided to make an offer to them to force a brief recess,  ``smores?''

``That sounds wonderful thanks Susan. How are you doing this must be a bit difficult?''

``I think I may be going psychotic. I swear you just called me a God or something I'm just trying not to think about it.''

``No don't worry about it. It's just a word. It doesn't reflect who you are as a person or anything.''

``So the not being hungry and not effected by garlic and holy things... I'm not getting better?''

``You're getting more powerful. Being effected by these things is beyond you.''

``Sunlight?''

``Beyond you. The greatest of the red court didn't need to feed often. You wont need to feed at all ever in time. Just eat a balanced for the growing vampire meal. You remember about high etheric food sources, yes?''

``Christ''

``Too rich. Stick with plain humans or solid food. You need a break I can tell. Maggie really is happy, she is living with the carpenters right now.''

``Oh my God really? They are a wonderful family! She will be very happy! And Harry?''

``Need you ask? Oh he is in one trouble after the next but nothing has stopped him yet.''

``Does he get any time with Maggie?''

``Not really but he is going to try.''

``That's so sad. Although I realize it was unexpected. I wish things could have been different.''

``I know you do Susan. Give things time they'll work out ok. They always do.''

``They're the only family I know. Can I call you Eury? I just don't know if things will really be OK.''

``Sure Eury is fine. Just give things time Susan, there is a lot you need to learn about your self at the same time. There are going to be ways you can contact them coming to you in the near future try not to worry.''

``Father Forthill seemed to not want to even talk to me. I think all this vampire stuff he has just forsaken me or something.''

``Father Forthill is going to very quickly be one of your most staunch supporters Susan just have patience. Your very existence to the man without understanding anything more makes his evil alarm go off. He has had dealings with very nasty things in his day.''

``That's true. I could be a very nasty vampire for all he knows trying to trick him.''

``So Eury, you and the three wise men, what are you exactly.''

``Well, in ancient times we were the Gods of the world. In that time between the Great Old Ones and the modern pantheons. We were all known by different names. There are a precious few that follow us now we are mostly just working through energy conduits..''

``Just the three of you?''

``No there is more than you could count actually. The three of us just hang around each other a lot.''

``Sounds like an interesting life.''

``You'll find out more as time goes on.''

``Well the sun will soon be rising, and I'll be heading down for breakfast. Are you guys staying longer?''

``We will need to be getting back to where we were, there is only the matter of your true form.''

Susan's stomach sunk to the ground. Their words of her being a full red just hit her hard enough to knock out teeth. In a very small voice she pleaded, ``Please no.''

Eury responded, ``Susan your true form is going to demonstrate to you more than we could ever in words. You need to see yourself as you are. After that we will leave and see you at times in meditation. Perhaps even meet for another BBQ someday soon. If it's alright I would like to come to you to help you make the change.''

Susan nodded. She could feel his cool presence and he connected with her spirit. He showed her how to release her mask and in the process she learned how to manipulate her mask. As the layers of skin mask peeled away her eyes were closed and she was shaking unwilling to look at herself. Eury touched her spirit again and a very cool and calming sensation overtook her. In this kind spiritual embrace she opened her eyes. It was her standing there, ebony skinned and glistening from the vampiric secretion. She was muscled and athletic, the kind of body most people wish they had but could never achieve. Her hair was long and flowing and she had wings. Oh yeah she had wings. She was over 10 feet tall with black feather wings that were a hundred feet tip to tip fully extended. As big as she was she was both strong and very light, like she was partly buoyant in air. She was in all respects an angel, a dark angel.

``I, I'm beautiful'', she stammered.

``Yes you are. Perhaps this will help you understand yourself better.''

Susan smiled huge, threatening tears. ``Do I fly?''.

``You would be the first and last red to truly command the skies. With practice you will fly better than anything else out there.''

The smile broadened. She must be a magical creature because those 100 feet of wings tucked in behind her like they were hardly there. She can even wrap her wings around herself to stay warm.

She wished them well as they slid back into the mist and back to their world.

She slid back in and advised carlos her party was just breaking up now, and she is going to her chamber to meditate a few hours to catch up. She cast the balancing circle she was taught, and meditated inside for many hours. It was a lot to take all at once and she needed the rest. She could swear Eury's cool presence was on that circle bringing peace to her troubled mind.

The following day brought magickal study, beginning with the material she was given she had sigil and dream magick on the curiculem. She also spent time shapeshifting now that she knew that she knew that she could. She found it to be a skill. She could change herself into any creature or change anything about herself including clothes. She needed to observe what she wanted to become long enough before it would be convincing. She stared at different fabrics to change her clothes colour. She could only change clothes that she shapeshifted of course ordinary clothes she could not change. She became Jose for a little while, then a little bird she seen on a wire. She snuck up to the battlements in true form in broad daylight and lived to tell the tale. She is rubbing some kind of unholy oliem on herself now she got from Eury because it gave her the worst sunburn ever. It wont regenerate either. Live and learn.

She also did some battle training in the hall, hopping like a cat and skipping through mist. She was also trying to learn the different ways she sees which seem to be quite complex.

Outside she located a boulder that must have weighed in at 2 tons, raised it and lobbed it far into the forest. ``OK, epic strength, let's move on then for sanities sake.''

Marcos helped her quite a bit today with her dream workings. The doc leached him again and so he spent most of the day sleeping just from sheer exhaustion. Knowing that dream working is meant to be a solitary thing of course Susan just decided to bridge the gap and move into other peoples dreams,  and learn more about her powers that way. She had near total control in a shared dream state, though Carlos did pick up on his own ability to control the shared dream. Shared dreaming could be dangerous she doesn't have the same control there as in the real world. A more powerful or even just any hostile being could do her real harm. Finding Marcos was hard, there had to be something unique. An item in the room that she is familiar with, a familiar room. Something intimately his like a drop of blood or a fingernail. Knowing him wasn't good enough she needed that physical link to get into that room where he slept. Even then it didnt tell her where that room was physically located.

Later she found she can shapeshift simple weapons and other items onto her person. Swords, bows, staves, and such. Firearms are too complex and items that leave her body become goo. So a bow is useless unless she has real arrows. She cannot shapeshift with normal clothes and if she goes trueform the real clothes get torn to shreds.

Late afternoon she rooted some android devices to loop-mount kali linux. She apprenticed under a black hat network security enthusiast for a while (commonly known as an ``evil hacker''). She tries not to let the knowledge get too fuzzy but she will always need to research howtos to make things happen it's never been a big priority for her, always the journalist.

After a good meal she went to the battlements after the sun was well set. She proceeded to launch into the sky from there at first like a drunken jay bird slamming into the ground over and over again all night long but by the end of the week she was quick and skilled as a bird of prey.

She also took time to memorize different camoflage patterns and bdu uniforms, as well as practice shapeshifting them, for when she is ``in the field''.

So much work taking away from her time with the community. With the renewal of the old basilica though the main hall is used often and she is able to spend time and join in the community and parishioners. It has been great for getting the community together the church building was too small to hold social events before or to meet after mass.

Time passed slowly. Then while Susan was at work in her alchemy lab a call came in.

``yo.''
``Susan it's father Forthill.''
``Holy s@, sorry father just surprised''
``I understand you would be, I want to apologize for the way I treated you when you called.''
``I understand father. I rose up from the grave asking about Harry and Maggie.''
``Heh. Well I still could have been less abrasive. I spoke to father Antonio it's quite the story.''
``Even more confusing living it than hearing about it.''
``I can accept that. Something me and father Antonio agree on though is that tremendous grace has been flowing through you.''
``I can't see that really I'm not all that catholic, or christian for that matter.''
``Doesn't really matter though, anyone can be a conduit for Gods grace, and I think with your struggles it's important to see the forest through the trees.''
``It seems to me you may have called for more than just to talk to me about trees.''
``Yes well I do believe you now Susan and I'm going to send you work when I can, things in middle or south america. To help you out. I'm still going to keep quiet up here about you it just isn't a good time. Maggie needs the stability of a good home and should have at least one living parent to care for her.''
``Uh oh, that sounds ominous. Harry is still a walking disaster?''
``Like you couldn't know Susan.''
``I'll fight hard to do a better job at staying safe father.''
``Dear God please do. Also I do actually have something for you.''
``I'm listening.''
``In San Jose, the east end, there have been sightings of hollywood style zombies wandering the street at night. Call father Gomez, here is his number.''
``Thanks father I'll be all over it, quick question before you go, is there anything in Maggies room from when she was with me?''
``A few, her favorite bear Mortie she always keeps in her room. Maybe you remember him?''
``Do I ever, thank you so much for that.''
``Oh dear sweet child I wish I could do more than that to bring you together.''
``You would be surprised what you have done just in that.''
``Well if there is anything you need, anything at all please call Susan.''
``I will thanks father.''

I'll check with Jose and Carlos tomorrow but tonight I need to find my little girl.

Wherefore art thou Mortie.

I can sense you. Who is near you. I see it. That must be her.

Once upon a dream were we.

``Are you an angel? Those are such big wings.''
``No child I am only Susan. Would you like to play with my tea set together? Then if you like we can fly up real high together and look for miles around.''
``That sounds fun.''

So almost every night from that point forward mother and daughter would play together as the little child dreams.
