Welcome to my first attempt at writing anything. Like. Ever.

This book is written using LaTeX. It's all you need to get started working on the book.
The application is available for, well, everything from phones to tablets to computers usually for free.

What you can and can't do is in the license, see `LICENSE' for a layman's version.

LaTeX apps:

windows					MiKTeX
Linux/UNIX				TeXstudio
android					TeXPortal + any text editor
iPhone/iPad				just shy of $15 - Texpad, TeXWriter.
iMac					MacTeX


Additionally without the apps above any text editor can be used for writing which makes it flexible to an insane degree. You just have to compile somewhere else is all.

Anything I refer to as "manly" is highly technical and probably will make most people angry from the steep learning curve (including me, heh.) optional "manly" tools and tips are in the groundwork/manly folder.

I started using ftp to sync all my devices but you could use google drive, dropbox, or anything convenient. In the end I started using "git" on "github" because I wanted to show my wares to people and open the possibility of having others join the effort in different ways. I even got a free webpage so I could put it in the book source to invite readers to visit!

I use FreeBSD on my home computer so I can use the virtual terminal for some writing. It presents nothing but a black screen so I can write without distraction. It was indespensible for when I needed it but I don't recommend that operating system for the faint of heart. A nice uncluttered operating system that isn't quite so manly would be any linux running mate in my opinion. Yes it's just opinion I think mate is a good simple screen. Ubuntu Mate would be the most popular of the type. It also has virtual terminals if you wanted to try a hand with it. "vi" is the best editor to use in the terminal but there will be a help file for the concept in the groundwork folder under "manly". More or less required apps will be listed in Groundwork. Linux/unix have virtual terminals but Macos and Microsoft Windows do not.
Everything has a terminal window though when a git app is installed and working.

For anything in the this book source package I tried to use file formats that are compatible with free software (as in FOSS) and as widely compatible as I could. The software used I will list under manly if you want to follow a similar path. libreoffice isn't manly at all though so keep it as a priority if you don't already have MSoffice that can import odt files. Anything can import RTF files

The Susan.tex file is the root document that contains the source used to format the book. Always compile from this file only. I grabbed it for free off the internet (I didn't write the code myself, I may be crazy but I ain't that crazy) and changed it somewhat to suit my needs. It came from 
Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/fiction-novel/pjdthvgdtsfy#.WBITwsIpAol).

The other tex files are the chapters. They are almost straight text and the numbers designate the chapter they contain.

The pdf produced from a compilation is fully typeset and ready for the printers to produce books. Compilation from pandoc to epub. The epub should be touched up using sigil then it's ready for reading on ereaders and passing that epub through calibre to get a mobi file makes it ready for use on kindles.

recently there has been a glitch in pandoc and the title page wont compile into epubs anymore. A fix to allow compilation is in the book source as pandoc_susan.tex so run pandoc on that file instead and it works.

So if you don't like the book, fork it. Show us what you got :)
