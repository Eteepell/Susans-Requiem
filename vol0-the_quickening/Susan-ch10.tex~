Steve wanted to go down for me to meet his folks. I think it might be a little soon but he says no they'll love me. He warns me that they're very devout Southern Baptists so I have to be on my best behaviour. I say, ``Christ Steve how's this gonna work? Tell them I only eat catholics?''

``Probably best to keep the vampire identity under your hat. Remember it's not like I'm innocent either.''

``Well...''

``Trust me, it wouldn't matter to them who we eat even if it's just that we eat each other when we fuck. Think about it Susan.''

``Point taken, but the teeth?''

``Uncle Remy had grossly enlarged canines. He was born that way. I've been chatting with them ahead of time just in case. They think you're completely normal. If I didn't know better I would think you were completely normal.''

``Well shit thanks. I'll see if I can trade off the story the times has me on for something in the south and maybe we can work it in.''

``Sounds great!''

``Steve do they have ten thousand crosses, I'm allergic.''

``One or two in each room.''

``That I think I can handle.''

``Good start then. Lets see what we can do.''

``Your uncle had fangs?''

``Yup, the congregation wanted to put him out for being in league with the devil but my family worked hard to keep him in the church. There's still rumors that goes around twenty years later though.''

``Jesus, nice place.''

``nothing perfect, and don't forget to watch the language there.''

``Oh right. Gee, nice place.''

``Better.''

So I trade off a story for one about southern states and the modern day satanic-panic phenomenon. Actually sparks my interest anyway I'm glad to make the trade. Steve's family would be a good source too by the sounds of it. I'll bring my Daemonic paraphenalia along with my knitting and such one for a good impression and the other to find the paranoid southerners. Well, and to be closer to Eury that helps.

Eury comes over the night before the trip. We are driving down in Steve's Caddy. We both make really good money and have some nice things but we also live simply and save most of it. Me and Phil try and support our own house, the black court scourge, whixh puts some use to it. Steve just puts it in the bank and invests in things he uses for travelling which has been his life. He wants to settle down into private practice in New York though so we can be together. I love him for that.

``Let me pass on some rites to protect you down there Susan, first off is the rite for the blessing of water. It's unholy water you can use for healing and protection down there.''

``Well fucking eh, unholy water? Seriously?''

``yes quite. created by the blessing of the d\ae mon of water.''

``Who is this d\ae mon of water?''

``Don't be upset, his name is in the bible but it gets slandered a bit. Well, a lot. Used as one of many as a representation of worldly evil. Leviathan.''

``Jesus fucking christ on a stick the d\ae mon of water is the fucking chaos dragon? Jesus Mary and Joseph that's troubling Eury.''

``Don't be troubled, you've known me for a little while now and he's my brother and yours too. He looks a little goth if you ever meet him and he's ambiguous by nature so you may meet and work with his feminine aspect instead it's all according to how your soul resonates with him.''

``Weird, but I trust you Eury. You, Balberith and Babeal have been good to me and we fought together.''

``That's true, there are other names you know as well who you haven't met. Lucifer is the d\ae mon governing air, he is not satan like the bible has referred to him. He has been an ancient light god and that is what the name translates to. The bringer of light. He brings wisdom too.''

``What about Satan?''

``Whose name translates to adversary. There is quite the history there. There is a satan that is our emperor, the ruler of all that is, but he channels energy from ``The All'' to sustain creation. depending on how your spirituality developed The All could be an unintelligent energy, an intelligent spirit like the spirit everywhere of the native peoples or just simply the Christian God. A basic understanding of him is that he is representative of the left hand path and so the lawful adversary of the right hand path. The right often uses him as a scapegoat because his ways lead followers of the right hand path astray of the path to salvation. the opposite is true as well.''

``I don't think the concept of Satan serving God is a sane one.''

``Look at the dialogue of Job which is fairly accurate compared to the the figurative representation of the new testament.  There's a startling difference.''

``It still sounds like I'm allied with hell, satan, and all his minions.''

``Some of our followers don't even have satan in their heirarchy at all, and just work with us d\ae mons. In the end everyone follows their own path each of which especially those walking the left hand path is very different from the other. There is only one road to a happy afterlife, you either walk on the left or the right.''

``What are the core things about the left?''

``Well let's compare, know that left hand path exists in all religions really just often in obsure more hidden traditions, Buddhism, hindu, muslem, and so on. release attachment to the things of this world by indulging and making them boring rather than on the right which uses avoidance. Break every social norm and taboo possible for the same reason. Know that you are an God from birth and perfect yourself through faith and sorcery versus we are made in Gods image and acting accordingly, both different views of the same ideal. It is a path of the self which means self worship, we love ourselves basically and ask intervention of our higher selves. The great work in life is to come to union with our higher self sometimes called the holy guardian angel and that is to be made perfect and whole and fully developed in our Godhood versus seeking union with God. Everyone seeks to find enlightenment and prepare for the life to come those are some of the ways it's done on the left hand path.''

``I think I kind of get the idea, I've never been big on rel
