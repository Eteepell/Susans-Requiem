\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{A}t that moment I was beyond saving. I've been on the edge ever since my daughter Maggie went missing, and now here we are at the altar of \chichenitza surrounded by vampires and their many minions determined to sacrifice my baby girl on the altar. I need to save her. 
%scene conflict
My emotions are on high, I've been far too close to losing it and now dumbass Martin tells me he led my only daughter to the slaughter. I couldn't see through my rage, I was so far beyond control I don't even think an immortal could have stopped me. My vampiric part foreseen it's victory over my will and poured it's power into me and drove me quickly and irreversibly to my kill. It shackled me to it's purpose and terror came from my soul to intermix with the rage. My humanity foreseen it's own death but was unable to pull back, the vampire in me had stolen control to ensure it takes the life it needs to fully emerge. Quick as lighting and lithe as a snake, I took Martin down hard and made the kill with complete abandon. 
%scene disaster
I knew what was going to happen to me but Martin was calling the shots, using the one thing that would be successful in causing me to lose it. To really really lose it. I just didn't care. I desperately wanted to care. I could do nothing but devour his life blood. I tore out his throat the feeding was so vicious. When he was dead I was changing. It was too late, I couldn't take it back. I had control of myself but only for a few moments. Oh my God the pain, horrible intimate euphoric pain. Searing with power and pleasure as I experience the wretched agony of my flesh tearing from the inside out. I started to feel the pain give way to a new mass, a new body not my own was devouring me and emerging in my place. The monster has been set loose in me, in my loss of control I sacrificed a life to the slumbering vampire and brought it forth to consume me. I think my hands came first as they were elongated and clawed, breaking through my skin. I seen the new being crawling beneath my skin like a snake or worm, a ghastly sight to behold.

She is coming, the vampire that I am to be, she is not me. I could feel the others coming, other vampires. I heard the memory of the Red Kings call to battle. I hear them, I feel them. My vampire half is becoming whole in me, while I live it now coexists with me but I will not be here long. My soul is soon to be consumed. Harry reminds me I am the youngest of the red court now, I can destroy them all by my sacrifice. I can take every last one of the red court. I scream to Harry to save our daughter Maggie. Maggie was all I could think about, I have to save Maggie.

Harry took Maggie from the altar as gently as he could, and laid me down. I am still being consumed, I haven't much longer for my humanity to live. Harry promised me Maggie will be safe, I felt confident in his words. That didn't completely absolve my worry, and it did nothing to absolve the sheer terror I felt over what is happening to me. Harry was going to sacrifice me. I've never been so scared in my life but I still knew it would preserve me from the completion of my transition, and destroy the monsters that have caused so much suffering. Oh I was so scared. He closed my eyes with his hand, and kissed me. It was a sharing of our blood and our tears. I cried out to Maggie, perhaps just to tell her everything will be ok, but I don't think it came out as more than a whisper.\\
%no, and furthermore

\textit{Then Harry cut my throat, and I was dying.}\\

All was black, but for less than a moment. Lighting came down from the heavens and struck me in the darkness, maybe it was a dream, but it kept frying me for what seems like forever. I felt the consumption of my body, well, come to completion. Bye bye human me. After a time I felt myself floating up and seen myself, my blood flowing out from all over the altar. My body glowing and sparking with energy repeatedly, like when lightning hits a large transformer in the street. The energy slowly being absorbed. The vampires were gone, my friends survived. I am dead. The whole red court is gone including myself the youngest of their kind. Thank God for that. Soon enough I know that sweet chariot is going to swing low and come to carry me home.

Harry was in such pain. I could see it. I rested my hand on his shoulder and tried to talk to him. He neither felt it nor heard it but I could do no less. Harry is standing there, in shock, not moving. The vampires all fell leaving nothing but black sludge. The infected were mostly killed except the younger ones, since the vampire part was killed and it was what was keeping many young, even alive. 

%scene continued with Erlking
Walking toward the altar is the Erlking and I take my place beside Harry.\\

	``Huntress, Sir knight, well met.''

I had to check but yes, I'm still a ghost. I turn to Harry with a tear. Yes ghosts have tears, apparently.

``To you as well.'' I said.
	
	``I hope thou wilt be pleased with the strength of thine new nature huntress. Nay, I played no small part in bringing it to you. I was most certainly pleased that thou wert the first to have been my guest. Thou art honorable and wise my dear, such cannot be hidden in you. Thou likely thinkest that thine visit to mine realm twas coincidence? Be not a fool I willed it so. I was needful that you could be near me, that I might know that thou wert pureborne.''

	The Erlking smashed Maggies shackles and placed her in Harry's hands. ``Thou art the greatest hunter of thine kind, I cleared thine path for you. I ensured that thou wert slain. Your life has been hideous child, thou wert pitted against thyself like thou wert thine own prey, to live thou wouldst needfully refrain from the kill and blaspheme thine own nature. It is now abolished in you. May you and yours now hunt in freedom and rejoice in the kill. Thou hast redeemed thine species in the shedding of thine own blood. Thou art now free to join your hunt without fear of destruction. Thou canst replace these dishonourable wretches with thine own children as thee see fit. A pity I could not get the chance to hunt the red king and his ilk myself.''
	
	I don't see where I can enjoy the hunt as a spook, or how me and Harry can make little spooks together. Bloody Markov chains I'm gonna have to wait out the answer.

``Perhaps you might elaborate more and explain what you mean?'', I said.
	
	``Thou art always welcome as mine guest o' queen, then shall we speak together by the fire enjoying our kill.'' The Erlking bows low to me. He looks at Harry with a sort of piteous eye, ``I promise that by my hand thine mate shall not be slain. I know thine mate twas torn from thee in a most hideous way.''\\

Then at that he swiftly left on his way. Harry seemed to come to his senses after what seemed like forever. Just as well he would have been confused as fuck. I know I am.  As a matter of fact a helicopter came in and landed taking in a couple people, then left. Harry still stood there with a thousand mile stare, holding Maggie. I stayed with him, I wouldn't leave him, even if he couldn't see me. I hear our friends conversations with my enhanced hearing. I sat there with Ebenezer and Harry while they chatted, they were none the wiser. It's amazing he is actually Harry's grandpa, I wonder what other wizards are in Harry's line. I wonder if my Maggie will be a wizard when she grows up? I'm not sure how to feel about that. I still sat there with Harry as Karrin came over to chat. Harry was determined he was going to give up Maggie for adoption. Oh my God I was scared, but then I realized what I did but giving her up to a familiar family was pretty close. I hope he decides against it but if he does let her go for a better life I would understand. The rest escaped into a portal and Harry's Faerie Godmother remained. I felt my purpose accomplished and as I heard the sound of a vehicle approaching I begun to feel light and being pulled somewhere. Well this is it then, I'm going home to the family I've never known. I get to see the hereafter and Godwilling enter into paradise. I was being pulled toward the altar. My body was melting into the same black sludge as all the reds had, mingling with my blood and seemingly seeping into the stone of the altar. As it did I was drawn into it rather than being released like I expected. I was terrified that my soul was meant to be trapped in \chichenitza forever.\\

Fuck.\\

Then I was sucked into the alter.\\

I guess that chariot isn't swinging low for me after all.\\

%sequel thought
As I lay there some words I heard earlier that day keep repeating in my mind.
\begin{quotation}
	``You son of a bitch,'' I said, ``You fucking traitor.''
	
	Martin’s expression flickered at my words. But his eyes never left the Red King.``I give you the Fellowship of St. Giles, my lord,'' he said. ``And I beg you to grant me my reward.''
	
	``Reward,'' I said, blind with rage,``What could they possibly give you, Martin, to make it worth what you’ve done\dots''

	``And what do you get?'' I said to Martin.
	The Red King states, ``Ascension.''
\end{quotation}

I hear him say ascension over and over again in my head. What is happening? 

%transition 4days
I did lie in the alter many days. My eyes could see the sun rise and set upon that altar, the surface of my solid tomb. I could feel the warm sun and hear the breeze and chattering tourists. I thought to myself that it's not so bad being stuck here. I have company, I'll get used to it.
%sequel emotion

I'm dead. The silence of this altar allowed reality to catch up with me. My life has been wasted. Ever since I was half turned life has been nothing but a struggle and getting killed has been my only release from it. I knew it would be that way though, deep in my heart I knew the only escape was death. The fellowship had been working on a cure for a vampires turning ever since the fellowship came to be hundreds of years ago. They never found it. Either I must die, or make a kill and allow the vampire part to consume me and take over. I think Harry is going to be ruined, the man is going to need full time therapy when he gets back. Sure he's tough but this is too much. On top of that if Maggie were aware of anything going on she will be scarred for life. I want to just hide in this altar indefinately, just hide away from the reality of what happened outside of here in that world outside. Hide from the hereafter and from what other transitioned souls might say in my afterlife. What am I really? Innocent or guilty of making a kill? Depends on who you ask I guess. I place no blame on Harry I climbed right up on the altar and waited on him. The question is am I culpable of something?

What an odd word to use when Martin would perhaps be promoted within the court, raised to an office of a position, ascension is like to a king ascending to a throne of Christ ascending to heaven or a lesser being ascending to Godhood. Would the Red King really want Martin, being of a traitorous nature, to take power to himself in a worldly way much less a supernatural way? Really, who is Martin to raise him up to any position when any given responsibility would be poorly invested in anyone who could have executed such a grievious betrayal as he had done. The red king is mad but I don't see how he could be that mad. So if it was intentional it may be something the king was going to inflict him with, ascended and enslaved. Given significant power. Or something Martin was to cause, his actions are to cause and ascension of something or someone else. Everything is speculation right now.
%decision
I need to find out, something big is going on I feel it. I need to understand it and what role I'm playing in this game. who is the mastermind and what are his intentions? I'm in danger even as a ghost. Since I got sucked into this altar it's pretty clear to me something is weird and why would the Erlking have said that weirdness that he did? I'm all questions and no answers, very fews clues either. I need clues. I need answers.

%action
It's midnight, on the fifth day. I feel my body rise, the next thing I know I'm lying on my back on top of the altar. My arms are crossed fists on shoulders, my head laying to the side. It made me think of a song, ``walk like an egyptian''.

\parasep
%switch now to present tense, flashback is concluded.
%scene goal

I look at myself and shudder.\\

Oh God, I'm not human. This is the true form of the red court vampire. I really did complete my change. I feel normal though. I seem to be physically a typical red court vampire except maybe the odd thing, like talons rather than claws that resemble razor sharp scythes. I'm hungry. I'm very hungry. Oh my God sweet Jesus mercy and pass me an artery hungry. I have control for now. I catch the scent of human on the breeze and crouched low in a tiger's purr. The sound catches me by surprise as the red court never made such cat sounds that I'm aware of. I'm a little different somehow. I concentrate a little while and manage to put on a flesh mask, a convincing one, but being naked I decide to forego the flesh mask and go with the xenomorph look. A xenomorph born of a man sized vampire bat host is the essence of what a red court vampire true form looks like. H. R. Giger never goes out of style. 
%scene goal

So here's what I need to do then, find the nearest town and investigate more of what happened. I would look around here but I'm hungry. I've held my hunger as an infected I should be fine now, but not for long. Maybe I could take a couple sips while I'm there, I'm not that bad off right? A little nibble, that's all.

%introduction conflict, hunger drives her into damian, who prevents her from getting further

I leapt to the edge of the temple, onto the stairs of the pyramid. I'm smelling the air, I can't help it, my vision goes from black of midnight to the shadows of twilight as my eyes see through the darkness. I smell life-blood and I see the glow of human life off in one direction, at line of sight. With a growl I'm off. A growl, like a great cat. Not a shriek, wail or hiss as would be expected of my kind. Heh, my kind. Shoot me now. I laid tracks fast for the source of the radiance and I see someone driving a truck down the road and I hit the windshield at a speed faster than the truck was moving and smashed the bloody carcass out through the back window onto the road. I utterly destroyed the man tearing flesh from limb with my claws, chewing, sucking, lapping and gulping every last bit of the poor victim. They wont even be able to identify him with dental records. I'm too hungry to have any control. I genuinely hope someone just shoots me.

A black court vampire appears. He seems to be quite unusual, like from the Sherlock Holmes era, except for the chainmail gambeson draped over him and the combat boots he wears a very upper class Edwardian suit. God he looks cold as ice even for a vampire. He throws down a child he just consumed, a little 4 year old boy, blonde hair and freckles. dead and gone. He pops his collapsible top hat, and bows to me with a flourish of his hat. Then fills a pipe and speaks.

``Has anyone ever told you of natural selection? Foolish morsel decided upon himself to go forth into the night and deep forest I know not why. Most certainly I can say of him that he quite simply is a feeble-minded child. It is well that I had found him that he might be most effectatiously culled from the local herd. Alas it nearly came to pass that the noble vampire society might have been deprived of this most delicious morsel should he have perished in and of himself. Do you not agree dear lady? Yet as you are a most grievous poacher, oh what shall I do?''

``You fucking monster!''

``Ah yes, this I have heard many a time. 'Tis rare though that I should hear it from a kindred species, 'twould seem like to the pot calling the kettle black as they say. Let it be agreed then that I am a monster. So what of you dear? I cannot accuse you of wasting a single drop of that kill all chopped up and wrung dry so don't you dare be hypocritical. At least my kill is in one piece. I'm proud of who and what I am. Are you? I don't think you are.''
% scene climaxing

At that he withdraws something from his gambeson, damn. He's got a jar. Like as in ``A Jar'' trademark pending, a weapon I'm sure was first devised by the fellowship against the red court. Although not really used for anything but vampires, they may work on other supernatural entities or powers. They have no effect on humans. On vampires we used them as grenades and mines, hard as hell to get them triggered but when they do it's a guaranteed capture and the vampire is trapped in the jar which acts as a spirit container. We would then bury it deep, if we could drop it down with a post-hole digger we would. That way, just as Damian said, the creature would sit and rot until the second coming.

Problem is, now the shoe is on the other foot. I have no idea how he could be so confident that he won't get trapped but being I'm of the vulnerable species now I'm in hot water. He must be either crazy or stupid. My money is on crazy.

He casually taps the pipe empty on his gambeson and replaces it in his pocket, then drops his walking stick aside. He holds up his right hand and with a few words a slow moving black and purple ball slowly forms in his palm, the size of a basketball. I understood the words though I shouldn't have. I've never known such a language.

He said, ``Livyatan niis d ol nobloh tzrvt ollor adin zerimah''

Instinctively I know it means, ``Leviathan come, into my hand forms a gentle flow.'' Although I have no idea of the implications of the words. I repeat the words in english out of curiosity and see black and purple mist, unfocused energy flowing around me.

He says, ``Most singular indeed you are. It was best that I should have the jar.''

Without much warning he said, ``Lhtchl'' and the ball hurtles at me, I throw myself and roll. The ball curves toward me, I vault behind a tree and the ball crashes into the tree. The tree makes a low moan like it was being subjected to an immense weight then is still. Even the leaves flutter far too slowly given the force of the wind today. Impressive.

Then he said, ``Flereus niis lishloach mad setani prg lehashlich forth, pon in oyev'' and a ball of flame hurtled from his hand directly at me. Fire is not good, I'm particularily vulnerable to it.

To my surprise it burnt straight throw that same tree and it fell to the earth. That tree is going to kick my ass when I go on to the other side at the end of days. Of course it caught me off guard and I hurled myself just in time, it hit my left bicep burning it off straight to the bone and I wailed, the shoulder on my other side hit a rock hard on the ground where I fell and I wailed again. I leapt backwards with a shriek and came up to stand with two useless arms. I'm in big trouble now.

He decides it's a good time for a tackle, he lands where I was just a split second ago. I guess he forgot I had legs.

No he predicted it. His walking stick is special I see, he wielded it as a sword stick and sliced open my belly. I figured I was done for but the wound stuck and I managed to bear through the pain and land a hard kick on him. I break his neck, which heals itself before he falls to the ground. I really hate vampires. Myself included.

He grabs for the jar but I'm already on the road ready to speed away. he throws the swordcane hard and in crunches into my hip. I sorely miss my firearms. I had an automatic pistol once I really loved. Snap out of it Susan, don't drop now, fight.

I'm on the ground. I can't move. He is throwing the jar for the final attack. I'm at the rear quarter of the truck. My arms are working again. I throw a rebar off the truck which goes right through his side but it only redirects the jar slightly from my head to the steel quarter panel where it triggers.

It was right where it needed to be. Right in the sweet spot. Inky black smoke licked out of the jar and just as I was afraid of it enveloped me. It felt like being on the scariest rollercoaster ever. I shrieked. After that, I was a jar. It is surprisingly spacious for a vampire in a jar. I never knew that. Rather than infinitely small it's infinately spacious. Must have something to do with the magic used.

I'm keenly aware or what goes on outside though, and Damian is perfectly well healed from the rebar and is walking this way. All there is left for him to do is bury me. He walks off to the front of the truck and to the other side. A post hole digger. I'm getting good treatment. He grabs the jar, smiles at me, and as he starts to dig shouts go up in the distance. ``There! There's that monster and he has a shovel!''

Another shout goes up, ``What have you done with my baby boy?''

Damian drops the post hole digger and starts running just as 3 jars hit the earth beside me, two trip and are spent in a flash and the other didn't trigger. Thats the way they are. A good batch works well others are too sensitive or are just duds. Another reason I thought Damian a fool.

A man runs up first, then another, 

``Have you seen the child?''

``No I thought he might be here, just the vampire and he is probably long gone now.''

``Any of the jars still useable?''

The man uses a device we used that checks magical charge in the devices. We had to keep really good track because a charge could mean it's untriggered or\...

``I got 2 spent and 2 live, I thought you only loosed 3?''

``Must have been someone else down there, grab them.''

\... it already had an occupant. Sweet. I'm angry as hell though about that poor little boy.

``Jose, where do you think the little boy was taken?''

``Jorge I don't know. I think we have to start back at the village to pick up the trail again.''

Jorge said, ``What do you think are the chances now?''

Jose said, ``After this long? Most that come back are, they come back as something else Jorge.''

I was screaming inside myself, they have to find the child. They're right the boy will come back as a black court vampire. Jose seems to know at least some I hope it's enough. I'm yelling at Jose from in the jar, no vampire has ever penetrated their power through a jar but I'm feeling desperate.

``Jorge look here, tracks going toward the road. Gather the people we're going this way. Get the jars ready. Thank God for the fellowship in giving them to us.''

Your welcome Jose. Just hold onto me, I didn't get even close to what I wanted but I don't want to be left out here. Bring all the jars home.

They found the boy, Miguel, and burnt him on a pyre before the sun set that evening. Little Miguel is at peace now.

So I ended up with Jesus, pronounced hey zeus. So many jokes about that name. Anyway, he keeps his jars in his daughters room for protection. So I got to watch many hours of playtime. Time to think as well as I sat there on her shelf beside a raggity anne.

The rural areas are really dangerous, I really got screwed out there. So did that little boy. How many other people, even children, are becoming black court now? Are they going to be the menace that fills the vacuum left by the red court's demise? I cringe at the thought of an army of little Miguels marching through towns devouring people, maybe even their own parents. Like a classic zombie movie except the black court are very intelligent. Which is even worse. Did I do any long term good out here?

Well no, I can't think like that. There is a vacuum but there is a chance things are going to be a lot better than they were.



%scene development
I say, ``whoa buddy how am i supposed to know you had this one marked, you put a brand on him? Piss on his shoe? something?''

``How would we have had time to even cough hmm? You rode though here like you were on the back of a tomahawk missile. You are the most violent, loud and clumsy young bat I've seen in a long time. If you were my spawn I would kill you, so since you're not. We will all kill you. It seems fair.''

So they all surround me from the bushes, six in total. They would have had to have been smart and dangerous to have survived out here during the red courts reign so I have to act smart.

``I see you are likely thinking we must be good to survive out here so long. You're right. I know you aren't any ordinary red to come down from \chichenitza alive. You likely have known about jars like this yes?''

uh oh. The fellowship had been recruiting warlocks ever since i had known. The jar as they called it was one of the successful ventures that we undertook. Paranormal creatures like the reds and others could not always be defeated by any other way but capture. The jars could be used as grenades or mines to immediately trap the creature circumventing the need to traditional battle. The jar would then be buried safe many feet into the ground where the creature would spend eternity. Using jars would be dangerous for them too but with this many if one of them were trapped another could simply break the jar.

``Can we maybe just talk this out? Like you said I'm kinda new and now I know I should be a little less bold. So lesson learned. Live and let live right guys? Fellow vampires always support each other right?''

``Hah. Damnable reds with their insanity put all vampires in harms way. That court is gone and you alone are not part of any living court. I would be pleased to feast on your corpse to pay back all the misery your people caused.''

``That wasn't me. I'm the new guy in town. I finished my meal and meant no harm, why must I die?''

``That's just the way it's done. Even if I meant no ill will.''

``Is there something I can do?''

``Ok, sure we can make a deal. If you are here now you must have had birth through the altar, the central focus of the spell. Tell me names and locations of the team that assaulted the altar and we will let you go.''

I thought for a minute, what would it matter if I said who was there? Nobody at the top would be able to do much to my friends on their home turf. Then I thought it might lead them back to Maggie again and that's something I wouldn't allow. So after thqt moment of thought I said, ``No.''

``So be it then. See you in hell.''

All six started moving toward me and what was left of the truck, I couldn't be caught in restrictive cover when the jar is in play, somehow I need to keep that thing away from me. They wouldn't want to waste it, so triggering it when one of their own was near might waste it. Inevitably I need to get the hell out of here to be safe. Oh to be human again the jars would not be effective.






That town is the closest one to \chichenitza so should have the best clues as to what happened to me. I need to ask around and see what everyone knows. I'm still so  hungry. Jesus. I resume running for my destination. I enter into a village and spring for a tree. I smell quite a bit of food, between what I smell and the life energy I see I guess maybe two hundred? Hunting other humans is not a skill I want to get better at. So here I am up in a tree hissing and purring. This fact finding mission is not going so well, I need to calm down. I'm sensing something close, I leap to another tree and see some teens outside what looks like a drinking hole. It's a start, they might know something, I need to find clothes first though since first impressions count. Watching, I see one move around the corner to urinate and I land on him fangs first. I hold him fast with a powerful grip of my talons. He's done after a few minutes but the others have disappeared likely around a corner. This is not going so well so far. Still hungry. 

I prowl back to the area they were, I smell prey close. I also smell alcohol inside the building I'm leaning against. It looks like a four story building with a solid roof. I scale the walls like a cockroach to the roof and perch, waiting for more prey. I hear a shout come from the rear of the building, where my last victim lay. The call is going out for a vampire in the town and the people are scurrying about. I don't really feel like I should care. I think I would be better off dead anyway than to suffer through a life like this. I hate myself with a passion. 

I leap to an adjacent building to see options, how can I get into the village to ask the difficult questions? It's what all us reporters do, albeit no other reporter in the world would have this particular problem. At least I hope not.

A dry cleaners, most excellent. I need to move across the square though. The building next door has about a dozen townsmen vampire-hunting. They don't see me yet but as fast as I am I can't cross that distance without being seen whether in true form or as a naked Susan. either would stick out like a sore thumb.

Hey, wait a minute, that's it.

I put on the flesh mask and run like hell for the dry cleaners. I hear rounds of hooting and whistling from the men and jealous disapproval from the women. Heh. Nobody is thinking much about vampires now as I bust the front door lock and roll inside. There is a roar of voices and laughter outside giving me time enough to throw something ugly and flowery on and walk back out. I looked up to see what seemed like half the town looking at me with various reactions. I just looked down and walked toward the tavern like I hadn't a care in the world. Around me groups of people especially at the tavern whispering and giggling. Occasionally some fellow would grope. One fellow I think I knocked out some teeth, then none would grope me after that.

I walked into the tavern and sat down at the bar. I ordered an ale but advised I hadn't anything to pay.

The bartender said, ``That ain't no worry miss. After that spectacle everything is on the house for you tonight.''

``That's mighty sweet of you sir. My name is Susan, what do you go by?''

``Frank. Do you mind me asking how you got caught in that situation tonight?''

``Well, rather not say sir. It would make the embarrassment worse I'm afraid.''

``Fair enough. Well enjoy the beer, I hope it helps matters.''

I did. I appreciate the fact I can still enjoy a beer. I always wondered if vampires could actually enjoy human foods and not have it taste like styrofoam or excrement for that matter.

God, I'm still hungry. I need some way to deal with that but I'm not sure how.

I see Frank head to the side door to speak with someone then return.

``What's up Frank?''

``Reports of a vampire, poor kid was taken by one in back but noone has found it yet. Where did you come from miss, and I never caught your name?''

``It's Susan. I came down from \chichenitza only just tonight. Hell of a mess these last few days.''

``Yeah I've had the blue blues lately, I should go see the doctor.''

Uh, wow. Bartender is fellowship! Signs and countersigns were used with us to identify ourselves. Each cell held a secret key and each soldier held their own. We had numbers stations broadcasting our ever changing public key on shortwave trying to keep one step ahead of the reds. It decrypted to a word or phrase we could use to identify each other as well as codes to authenticate cells and individuals. On the day of the battle the sign was blue, countersign honeycomb.

``I've heard eating honeycomb helps cure the blues.''

``manere in missione?''

I whisper to him, ``authenticate bravo bravo alpha november foxtrot whiskey.''
he responds, ``I authenticate alpha whiskey november november quebec tango''

``Jesus, are we still operating?''

``yes, the authentications you have are 5 days old in fact. There is a vacuum and other species are moving in and the wilderness outside the towns are chaos.''

``Bloody hell.''

``Here, a portable shortwave. Our number stations are still broadcasting at least for now. Do you still have your certificates?''

``No, just memorized the authentications from the day of the battle.''

``How are you just coming down from \chichenitza now?''

``Got sucked into the altar. Weird shit. Must have been some effect caused by the execution of the ritual.''

``Likely, it was like the end of days up there. The power of that magick lit the sky with terrible lightning and eclipsed the sun.''

``Seriously? I don't remember anything it's all just black.''

``Anyway, let me radio out for some new certs for you. I'm an area coordinator so I have the authority for it. All that much so since my area includes the site of the battle. I've had to reissue quite a few certs that day.''

``That's great thanks Frank. Do we have an encampment nearby?''

``No. The closest one is that town in Costa Rica that we had our largest medical facilities. You remember it?''

``I think I'm going to head down there to regroup and see what I do from here. I'll leave you to your duties Frank. You have vodka?

``Heh. One of those days. I absolutely got the hard stuff. Straight up?''

``Straight up.''

Frank served some more then went into the kitchen. I could see he went into the office. I figured he went in there to radio me some new certs. I kicked it back and relaxed. I'm still hungry but I can hold it for a while. I wish I could get rid of the hunger I'm just not the evil corrupt vampire I was meant to be. I hate my life.

Wow Frank is taking forever. It should only take 20 minutes at the most for him to get new certs I've seen it done before. It's been over an hour already. I gotta see what's up. I can't just walk through the kitchen someone might stop me and if any of the kitchen staff sees him obtaining new certs it would compromise his cover. I need to go around through the side door, I remember a window on the office when I made the kill on the teen. God help me.





















As I sat brooding a little girl came around the corner.

``Are you the vampire girl?''

``Why yes, yes I am my dear.''

``You're not dead?''

``It would seem not. Whats your name?''

``Maria, what's your name?''

``Susan.''

``I didn't know vampires have names''

``We do. We were people once too.''

``I'm told vampires are bad monsters''

``We are. vampires turn people into other vampires and they become monsters.''

``You don't seem to be a monster, except you eat people that's very bad''

``Yes it is, and I'll need to eat more people soon I'm very hungry''

``Please don't eat me''

``I won't. I'll eat someone else.''

``There is a jail north of here. There's drug dealers and other very bad people. You could eat the bad people.''

I smiled at the little girl. ``Thank you! I'll eat the bad people for you.'' I give her a hug, and soak her with the blood on me.

``ew.''

``sorry. I'm going to go eat the bad guys now. You should go back to your mom I wouldn't want to see you hurt by bad people out here.''

``I will. Be careful Susan.''

So she ran off to her mom, and I double time it to the north of the village and there is one hell of a prison there. This must house baddies from far and wide. The walls are high and topped with razor wire. I pass the wall by going to noncorporeal form, I don't think anyone has created anything a vampire cannot pass. The yard is empty, it is still the middle of the night. I'll try and avoid the guards I don't want the people of the village hurt, they need to be protected from these bad guys. I return solid after passing the wall to conserve my energy. I duck and weave around the floodlights in the guard towers. I'm able to sense the cells, and it's nearly 3am. I don't have long. I pass walls into and through four cells devouring inmates claw and fang before the sun starts to peek out. I thought my skin was going to burst into flame! I seen the solitary cell in the back and fled into it right through the open door for speeds sake, closing the door behind me. I left a trail of smoke behind where my flesh was burning. I perched myself in the cell's ceiling for a rest. Yes I seem to be able to find rest in pretty much any position. I haven't been able to sleep though, not since I rose from death.

The shout went out and the alarm rang in the prison at about 9am would be my guess.

A guard entered the isolation cell, the sunlight leaking into the cell caused my skin to begin to burn. It was all I could do to keep from yelling out from the pain. The guard looked at the walls, then down at the floor. Fuck, some of the blood fell off me onto the floor. Just a couple drops but I think I just blew my cover. He looked up! Before he was able to yell out I had my hand around his neck. I dropped from the ceiling and shut the door from the pain of the light. He's mine now. I tease him a little, a nibble here and a tickle there, followed by a deep deep kiss. He took a truckload of venom and went under fast. I whispered my command to him and let him go. A command to forget. He left the room a little red around the collar and called out the all clear. I'm good for now.

The jail was rather busy that day while I hid. There was a significant amount of fear, fear that the reds were back. A fear that they never really left but only drew back to regroup. I'm causing chaos here and it isn't what I want at all, I'm just trying to get by long enough to overcome my present state. As night fell I peered out into the jail. There are guards and volunteers taking shifts on the floor, armed with goddamned incendiary shotguns and holy items. Looks like holy oil and water as well. I'm pretty much fucked. I look for the guard I enthralled but I don't see him anywhere. I need to get the hell out of here somehow.

I can go non-corporeal to pass walls and doors but I have no fucking clue how to stay in that state to do anything else. It's not like I have a full red court master or mentor to teach me the ropes. Not that I want that, I just want back to normal. So I look around, the cells of the inmates I fed on are empty now, off to my right. 4 stories of row upon row of cells are to both sides of the hall facing forward, continuing for 20 cells in series. Twenty people sitting or sleeping in the main hall here sweeping flashlight and naptha lanterns. It's well lit in here tonight.
