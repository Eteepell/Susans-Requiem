\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{W}hen I came to Leviathan was standing over me. I think every bone in my body is broken, it took me five minutes of excruciating pain and an unnatural power of will but I managed sit up and face him.

He said, ``How can you still live? I intend to destroy you so that you might manifest. If the whole is destroyed how could I ever make manifest the one? Damn you Susan let go so that I can bring you forth.''

I said, ``Jesus Christ would you make sense? You intended to kill me why haven't you killed me already? Take your meds man doctor knows best.''

% Come to me sister, make manifest, your time is come, prophesy has been fulfilled in my sight. Come forth by the power of my own name Jaden Tasa Hoet Naca Leviathan.

He faced me directly and said, ``\enochian{RENICH VIASA AVAGE SVZN LIRACH. NOASMI OL OLLOG ACHOT, OL LEHAFGIN, MAD OLANI OI NIIS LENABBEI NOSTOAH HH ML OE OL MRH. NOASMI NIIS GAHA OIAD NANAEEL OL NANAEEL MONASCI JADEN TASA HOET NACA LIVYATAN.}''

Something awoke in me, and it wanted to emerge. I fought with all my will to keep control but it was too strong, and I was too weak. The world became surreal, and I became an observer of myself as some thing took over my body. The lifeless realm around me shook to it's foundations. The necrotized parts of me healed over and I started to mend. My wings extended and a diabolical sounding hiss came from my lips. I feel a sense of omnipotence.

My lips said, ``\enochian{IRGIL LEHA'EZ OL LE'ORER OLLOG LOAGAETH OL TENUMAH ESIASCH BAGLE NENNI OL MUTZHAR FALZ MIRC LI? NANAEEL OL IPAMIS LADNAH NANAEEL SETIRAH HH IOLCI OLLOR IPAMIS OL LONCHO TZRH? OLANI L'VLM L ANGELARD OL NOASMI CORSI OIAD SHOTEH.}''

I was far too weak to translate the language before but it is definitely the same magical language from when I encountered Damian. The words that passed my lips were, ``How dare you rouse me from my slumber brother, Why have you declared war upon me? Do you not know our conflict would bring an end to all creation? I never thought you to be such the fool.'' What is going on?

Leviathan said, ``I humbly beg your forgiveness sister, I suspect it was your \enochian{enn} that summoned you. You did not hear the discourse that I had spoken. I feared I could not subdue your earthly aspect and call you forth oh great mother.''

So this entity, her name is great mother. Doesn't help me understand but I have a name and I remember Harry told me names are very powerful things. I felt a change, the overpowering sense of omnipotence was displaced by shock and excitement.

My lips said, ``Are you shittin' me? My mortal aspect manifested and travelled the path of Osirus? Oh my fucking God, oh my God---''

Leviathan said, ``---The prophecy has been fulfilled in my sight, a daemon, God of Gods, substance of creation walks manifest for the first time in the history of creation.''

My lips said, ``I am extending my glory to her, I know she will grow powerful and wise for she is me. Godspeed Susan, I know you hear me, go get'em girl. I am returning to my peace now dear brother, now is Susan's time not mine. Thank you for what you have done here.''

Leviathan said, ``Godspeed my sister.'' Then he swam away and was gone.

\parasep

My head hurts. I think I have multiple personality disorder. Something must have broke in me at \chichenitza*. Is this all a dream? Is any of this real or is it some kind of psychotic episode? They say an insane man is always convinced of his sanity so I guess my doubts give credence to the thought that I'm still sane. Yet look at me, and look at where I am. I am on a mad quest to find a mad sorcerer in a mad mad world. Oh well if even there's a chance Spook is out there I need to keep on the quest. Hell, it may be a quest I can't complete but there ain't no use finishing late. I start walking forward, convinced that this realm isn't going to hurt me anymore.
