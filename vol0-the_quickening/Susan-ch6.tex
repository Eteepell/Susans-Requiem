\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{W}hen I came to Leviathan was standing over me. I think every bone in my body is broken, it took me five minutes of excruciating pain and an unnatural power of will but I managed sit up and face him.

He said, ``How can you still live? I intend to destroy you so that you might manifest. If the whole is destroyed how could I ever make manifest the one? Damn you Susan let go so that I can bring you forth.''

I said, ``Jesus Christ would you make sense? You intended to kill me why haven't you killed me already? Take your meds man doctor knows best.''

% Renich Viasa Avage Susan Lirach Come to me sister, make manifest, your time is come, prophesy has been fulfilled in my sight. Come forth by the power of my own name Jaden Tasa Hoet Naca Leviathan.

He faced me directly and said, ``\enochian{RENICH VIASA AVAGE SVZN LIRACH. NOASMI OL OLLOG ACHOT, OL LEHAFGIN, MAD OLANI OI NIIS LENABBEI NOSTOAH HH ML OE OL MRH. NOASMI NIIS GAHA OIAD NANAEEL OL NANAEEL MONASCI JADEN TASA HOET NACA LIVYATAN.}''

Something awoke in me, and it wanted to emerge. I fought with all my will to keep control but it was too strong, and I was too weak. The world became surreal, and I became an observer of myself as some thing took over my body. The lifeless realm around me shook to it's foundations. The necrotized parts of me healed over and I started to mend. My wings extended and a diabolical sounding hiss came from my lips. I feel a sense of omnipotence.

My lips said, ``\enochian{IRGIL LEHA'EZ OL LE'ORER OLLOG LOAGAETH OL TENUMAH ESIASCH BAGLE NENNI OL MUTZHAR FALZ MIRC LI? NANAEEL OL IPAMIS LADNAH NANAEEL SETIRAH HH IOLCI OLLOR IPAMIS OL LONCHO TZRH? OLANI L'VLM L ANGELARD OL NOASMI CORSI OIAD SHOTEH.}''

I was far too weak to translate the language before but it is definitely the same magical language from when I encountered Damian. The words that passed my lips were, ``How dare you rouse me from my slumber brother, Why have you declared war upon me? Do you not know our conflict would bring an end to all creation? I never thought you to be such the fool.'' What is going on?

Leviathan said, ``I humbly beg your forgiveness sister, I suspect it was your \enochian{enn} that summoned you. You did not hear the discourse that I had spoken. I feared I could not subdue your earthly aspect and call you forth oh great mother.''

So this entity, her name is great mother. Doesn't help me understand but I have a name and I remember Harry told me names are very powerful things. I felt a change, the overpowering sense of omnipotence was displaced by shock and excitement.

My lips said, ``Are you shittin' me? My mortal aspect manifested and travelled the path of Osirus? Oh my fucking God, oh my God---''

Leviathan said, ``---The prophecy has been fulfilled in my sight, a daemon, God of Gods, substance of creation walks manifest for the first time in the history of creation.''

My lips said, ``I am extending my glory to her, I know she will grow powerful and wise for she is me. Godspeed Susan, I know you hear me, go get'em girl. I am returning to my peace now dear brother, now is Susan's time not mine. Thank you for what you have done here.''

Leviathan said, ``Godspeed my sister.'' Then he swam away and was gone.

% Sequel
My head hurts. I think I have multiple personality disorder. Something must have broke in me at \chichenitza*. Is this all a dream? Is any of this real or is it some kind of psychotic episode? They say an insane man is always convinced of his sanity so I guess my doubts give credence to the thought that I'm still sane. Yet look at me, and look at where I am. I am on a mad quest to find a mad sorcerer in a mad mad world. Oh well if even there's a chance Spook is out there I need to keep on the quest. Hell, it may be a quest I can't complete but there ain't no use finishing late. I start walking forward, convinced that this realm isn't going to hurt me anymore.

Did I endure more mental trauma than I can handle in my transformation? Is my time limited before I must be imprisoned or destroyed?

If I am now as supernatural as what I have seen, and whatever it I am now, maybe there is something deeper. 

I wrap my wings around myself and sit down, grooming them instinctively, deep in thought.

Maybe there is another spirit in me. Maybe more than one. Maybe a good Susan and a bad Susan; a mighty Susan and a lowly Susan; God help me maybe there is a true red court vampire Susan as well as the unchanged human spirit that I identify as being the true me.

I have a hearty laugh thinking of something I've heard before. Fuck it. Alanis Morissette was right.

 I say it's best just to accept that I'm a complex being and move on. I may make mistakes along the way yet I will also save lives like I've done as well as beat the bad guys. I gotta give myself a break. Nice to meet you, ``Great Mother''
 
 I tried to sleep, wrapping my wings around me like a feathery sleeping bag but the deadly silence was unnerving and the cold penetrated through my wings. After the troubled rest I started again by wing and by hoof to rescue dear spook.
 
 \parasep
 
 I bore no hunger, no did I have any food to eat. Rest did not come, I was weary from day to week to month. This place stole my hope; it stole my laughter and my song; it stole every happy thought; it stole my memories, replacing them with abominations of truth; it stole my inner light, my sanity, my very soul. Evil has no place here, nor does good, there is nothing. It is oblivion, nothing made manifest. Every moment I fought dark thoughts that entered my mind; fought by logic; fought by disbelief; fought by will and by anger.
 
 Like a child who learns life on the street I learned survival and I learned how to fight. I learned about the darkness; about it's desire; about it's attacks; about it's strengths and weaknesses; and most importantly I learned how to manifest the power of my own spirit in battle with the darkness. I found within myself spiritual weapons. I fought my own darkness, my own inner leviathan, and I grew strong. I grew tough. I grew undefeatable, immortal, within my own psyche.
 
 I don't know how long it took to reach Spook, perhaps it was months; or maybe it took a year, or many years; or perhaps it took a millenium. I believe the more likely would be a thousand years yet in this place a moment is like an eternity of emptiness and inner pain. Regardless of how long it took Spook remained alive, I knew it in the deepest part of my soul. I never doubted it for a moment. I just kept moving forward; always moving forward. the only way out is forward; the only good is to save Spook and so I move forward.
 
 On the day I arrived I came to a bank on a river of blood. Spook lay on the bank in tattered clothes. Spirits circled and taunted him continuously and his body looked like a putrid corpse. Stinking, rotting, slithering with worms. I thought at first I deluded myself in thinking he was alive but that worm-eaten corpse sat up. His one remaining eye widened in disbelief.
 
 He said, ``Susan?''
 
 The guttural zombie-like tone is definately not Spook's, yet it definately is Spook. Is he ever a mess.
 
 I said, ``Spook? Jesus man what happened to you?''

He said, ``What happened to you? You look like some crazy ass Sumerian Goddess---''

Before he could finish I was on him trying to figure out how to help him. I realized if he was going to be dead he would have been dead a very long time ago. What happened to spook, well it's unnatural. It's just, wrong. I tried picking out the worms and maggots and they fell to dust then another would appear in it's place. Necrotized flesh healed itself but only back to it's original necrotized condition. Spook's state was the closest thing to a zombie I could imagine. I don't know what to do. I have no idea.

Spook said, ``Susan I don't know how you got here but I the path I chose in life led me here. I filled this river with blood and stole the life from my own body. I don't know how you found me but go find your own rest and leave me be.''

I said, ``I'm taking you back with me Spook, I won't leave you here.''

He said, ``Or you can fly off with those wings and lay an egg. I am not in any way going off to a vampire afterlife with you.''

I said, ``Spook this is not the afterlife, last I remember you were alive and not so well back on earth. You went mad.''

He said, ``Damn. Sorcerers madness. That explains some things. This didn't seem like any sort of afterlife I knew of. I think this place may be on the astral plane Susan. That's been my presumption. I guess I should have been more careful using black magic after my half vampire side died. The road to hell is paved with the best intentions they say.''

I said, ``You think you might know something of this place?''

He said, ``I'm not sure really, only theories I researched in my magical work. The astral plane is infinate and is formed by us when we choose to travel and build a domain there. The madness of black magic is a choice of will. It never seemed to me after seeing a mad sorcerer that it was in fact them there. Their eyes were just, empty of soul. Some degree of my theory appears to be true.''

I said, ``Do you know how to get the hell out of here?''

He said, ``Oh tell me it ain't so. You came all the way here with no idea how to get back?''

I said, ``I only had the one chance to get here as far as I knew. I had to take it, and figure out the rest as I went.''

He said, ``Oh pity the fool, I can get us home, but I need to get access to my astral temple. It's a wizard's tower and has been across this river ever since I got here. I tried to swim across it but the tide pulled me back everytime. It's part of the cruelty of this place I believe, that I should see my salvation within reach and yet I have been prevented from reaching it.''

I said, ``What exactly was it like here Spook? What really went on?''

He said, ``A dark fog had been growing around me ever since my vampire half died. I seemed to offend people but I didn't know why. I had thoughts of attaining power that I didn't have before. It didn't take me long to realize it was the sorcerer's madness coming on me because I felt it grow worse when I used my dark powers to assist the team. I thought I had it under control until this happened. I guess I was still wounded from before I was partly turned years ago. I just caused more scarring on top of what had already taken place so many years ago.

``I didn't realize what would happen. It was so sudden. It was like my spirit was pulled under from a strong tide and I sank to the bottom of a cold black abyss. I landed here. It feels like it's been a millenium. I found scraps of trash and built that little five foot doghouse over there out of torn aluminum roofing to sleep in. These bleeding riverbanks are abundant with filth and trash. Nowhere else on the horizon did I see anything but wasteland, trees and dust. Yet here there was garbage piled around me. I was thrown in a heap of trash as if to say this is what you're worth. I gathered some filthy clothes for myself out of here and tried to get by. I am always hungry but there is no food, thirsty but all there is to drink is blood from the river. Yet despite this I do not die. Soon after I got here sores started breaking out on my body. Worms broke free from the sores and they spread. My flesh was constantly being consumed endlessly. My worms never die, if I kill any others appear to take their place. No matter what I do I cannot die. Like you said I am deathless, and as far as I know I've been here a thousand years.

``Every moment I hope for death, but it never comes. I hope for an end to my pain but it never stops. Yet across that river might be my salvation and I think maybe I might reach it but I never do, the tides always pull me back. Even though I might be feet from the shore they pull me back and throw me into despair. Year after year I rest but never sleep, fight my thoughts, and endure my pain. I wash my clothes in a river of blood and wash my body with my tears. 

``I have been told madness and condemnation come to those who choose the dark side and the ways of black magic. Yet even as I sit here in my own hell I will still swear that not all that choose the darkness are evil, and not all black magic is diabolical. What of those who curse a cancer? what of those who hex madness or bring death upon starvation? How about those who return life to those die senselessly despite the skill of the surgeon, or heal the psyche of the person villainously attacked by an evil wizard?

``The white council of wizards condemn all these things because this is our end. I condemn them for not helping us who use dark power to help others. I hope to see them here for their calculating ways, in not helping us find the cure for the dark physicians who do for others what no one else can.''
