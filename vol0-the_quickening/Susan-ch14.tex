By our luck there was a cab on the way by that brought us closer to the location of the switch. We got on the subway. The subway car went dark and we slipped off to wait at the hidden station. A minute later and the royal train arrived and we began our descent. We were going faster this time, insofar as a train can speed we were clattering down and down on the long spiral of tracks.

I said, ``What is this library?''

Rodney said, ``I only know by legend. It has never been opened in living memory. Only the one true queen can do so it responds only to her. It is said to contain all knowledge of the dark ways, of magic and academic, holding not only books but objects and other learned items, and that in size it rivals the queens capital city itself. Or so the stories have told. I know the entrance and that no way has been found into it.''

I said, ``What would you have me do then?''

He said, ``There is an imprint of a hand placed clearly on the door. I could be wrong but I believe it could be as simple as placing your hand there.''

I said, ``Awrighty then. This is bad Rodney? Like really really bad?''

I said, ``You seem to indicate this is just the beginning?''

He said, ``This is just the beginning. It will lead to the end of days. It will come, the starborn is dead, lets just make sure it doesn't come soon.''

I said, ``Agreed. Let's get the library open for business.''

It wasnt long and the not so familiar fields of fire lay before me. Our train screached in. The workers in the field stood still to watch the sight. As we pulled into the station my car, if you could call it such, was just pulling into the station
