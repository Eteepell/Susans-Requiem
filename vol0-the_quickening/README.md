I used "github" because I wanted to show my wares to people and open the possibility of having others join the effort helping in this book or grabbing stuff and writing their own.

Any text editor can be used for writing so having tex installed on all your devices isn't necessary. You just have to compile somewhere else is all.

The Main-PDFTeX.tex file is the root document that contains the source used to format the book. Always compile from that file only. The Susan-ch??.tex files are the chapters. They are almost straight text and the numbers designate the chapter they contain.

The pdf produced from a compilation is fully typeset and ready for the printers to produce books. 

So if you don't like the book, fork it or grab a zipball from the homepage, show us what you got :)
