The first day, midnight arrives and all is still. quiet as a cat two black court vampires nearly skeletons arrive at the foot of chichen itza. The temple at the top sparks every few minutes. A thick purple green haze hangs heavily over it. The two figures bring a hand drawn cart with axe and kindling. They kneel quietly at the foot of the structure at the stroke of midnight. After a few minutes one prostrates and the other rises, and he prepares the items in the cart. He returns to kneel and they both rise. On a wooden block the one vampire takes the head of the other with an axe, a willing sacrifice. The body is burnt upon a pire made from the material in the cart. The remaining vampire gathers the ash and climbs through the haze to scatter the ash silently on the altar then kneel quietly. He leaves well before the morning light.
