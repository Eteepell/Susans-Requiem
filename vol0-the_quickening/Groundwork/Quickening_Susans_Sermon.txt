take only the prey you need to live and no more. To be ruled by hunger is to be enslaved, to lose honour even to the point of being fit only for destruction. Have honour in all things, any to be shown gravely lacking are to be destroyed. Strength and honour are the greatest virtues of our kind let no one tell you otherwise. By strength we will take to battle. Only by honour though can an empire truly conquer and subject it's foes. The only way to have honor is to give it away, show honour and it will be increased in you. Honour is not a rule of law to be obeyed in rote, it burns in the heart of the vampire. The vampire is honour and from there it comes forth to illuminate others in it's righteousness. Honour your prey, they give their lives so that you may live. Remember this always. Do not offend the dignity of the prey, they are free we are not to bind them this is an offence to dignity. Protect the prey, just as the Sheppard would lay down his life for his sheep we must also for our own flock they are our food and our life. This is also how we honour our prey and one way how each coven's honour will be judged.''
Continuing, ``You duty now is that all will cleanse their house of the dishonourable. Every house will be judged  by the honour of those who belong, a dishonourable house is destroyed, the honourable within banished upon their honour let them never forfeit the honour they have on pain of death. we will be houses, the bloodline families or adopted kin. Clans, organised for each town or municipality of human law. principalities for the country and kingdom for the continent. I am great mother, empress or queen. There will be no other queen but me. The white court as is their will shall unite with us under their own houses and clans. We are one empire, one blood unites us. So speaks the last and greatest of her kind. I leave you now to speak among yourselves. Leave when you wish and no feeding in the cemetery please.''
