To get started the most basic apps are these:

LaTeX apps(produces a pdf already typeset and ready to publish):

windows					MiKTeX
Linux/UNIX				TeXstudio
android					TeXPortal + any text editor
iPhone/iPad				just shy of $15 - Texpad, TeXWriter.
iMac					MacTeX

Maybe an office program (Libreoffice, MSoffice, googleApps, etc.)

That's it. Anything else is gravy.
