Recommended Manly Software (cue Tim Taylor grunt)

pandoc, produces epub for ereaders (command line program)
pdftk for touchup of the pdf produced, and attach files to pdf
sigil for touchup of the ebook pandoc produces
calibre to change the epub to mobi for use with kindles

hint: pandoc can compile the source into a lot of different formats
for different uses. available formats at bottom. It's interesting
it can output the InDesign format since that is a commercial product
the major publishing houses use internally for their own typesetting.

leo (an outliner) to generate a solid outline for the plot (steep learning curve)

git to keep a repository of source to use on multiple devices (and collaborate
concurrently with multiple people if the opportunity arises) and using 
github to show to people, and create a webpage really easy. easiest to
use on the command line, which seems odd that the graphical interface
is more difficult but it is.

vi for when I used virtual terminals to eliminate distraction (manly).
