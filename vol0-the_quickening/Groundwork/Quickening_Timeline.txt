attacks village and escapes

2week
miscreants follow her
they tempt her to feed, inciting her to enthrall them
susan refuses adamantly
temptations get worse susan struggles
resting one day under tarp they cut and smear susan and she breaks

3week
next week is bliss, the thralls are healing, susan is astonished it is true
character development especially of tina
thralls are killed off

6 week
susan continues south alone, can now tolerate day travel with pain
single kill in the 3 week period, feeling better about that
over and over again seeing atrocities on her journey both human and supernatural.
seeing the fellowship is still active here somehow with different enemies.
