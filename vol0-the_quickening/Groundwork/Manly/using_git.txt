after cloning to copy changes back and forth think of a laundromat.

pull the coin tray out
add the coins
shove in the coin try to commit the coins
push the button to start

just copy the commands exactly(including the dots, and spaces).
git pull
git add .
git commit -m.
git push

You could look up what they mean if you want, or just invoke the incantations
blindly which works just as well.

Be careful to do that everytime you work with your book source, both before and
after, because if you modify the same file on two different devices and the 
changes conflict you are going to pull your hair out trying to get it sorted 
out.
