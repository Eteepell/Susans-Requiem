More species of vampires many names nearly all fewer in number to warrant their own court. This forsakes the fact that phages in large far eclipse vampires proper.

Instant undead like dark souls but going hollow stronger desire to let go more peace is why need purpose or to occupy themselves to stay sentient. The resident soul wants to leave and if it does it leaves an empty shell behind, mindless undead, the exact same as the living leave a dead corpse.

Mutants constantly seeking original human DNA to stabilize and live.

The darkness is not existing to destroy the light but rather strengthen it in battle and the pruning of dead growth.

You are your younger self and just like any person in their youth they dont know themselves or their world well but they are now the most virile in their lives. You susan the younger are needed much more here in this time than any other. That's why you are here in this time and no other. What might that tell you?

Think ye that the gods of good have not defeated The dark goddess in a great battle or some great war that never ends? or that perhaps she seeks to end this world at all? Then know she desires life to continue no less than anyone. Indeed she holds her hand else the world would then truly end. She is both terrible and just with the heart of a mother. It is just as the true gods of death are the most caring of all. Because those places in their charge both living and death lost and grieving are the most needful of any.

One cannot presume the gods speak with infallable tongue. They may lie as sure as they may speak truthfully but only as it benefits us.

Distance of gods only reflects a stage in the development of man not power derived from worshippers. Same gods same powers same responsibilities. Now man learns his own power and godhood as well as learning how to be responsible to the world in which he exists. Closeness to the gods in earlier aeons was a time when the gods were rearing men like children, an early stage of development. Do not presume the gods to be any less powerful now as ever they were.
