Beelzebub the parasitics humans transformed by others swarms. Colonized by bacteria virii larvae and others to a superior human. Each parasitics swarm is part of their body. Living in a persistent ecstacy and engaging with each other accordingly. Reflects the growth of the colony near impossible to control libido but that ecstacy also ensures never true loneliness always the love inside. Groups of no less than 2 to care for each others needs. It resonates with their colonies desire to spread. Living 500 years average with persistent youth. immunity to poison and disease incl. Radiation illness and heavy metals. Vulnerable to injury same as human but cannot scar and always heals given time. Shortly after infection becomes hermaphrodite. Species lives mainly in more dirty and poor locations. No sense of disgust can each anything. Sense of smell is incredible eyes are near zero light all focused ...no peripheral mo need to focus...full 180 degrees. Can live days without a head and loss of limbs regrow over a long period of time ...2 or 3 years... hair senses air movement and aids the ear in hearing sound. Can see full range of visible and invisible light. Can sense the briefest movement and metabolism can accelerate and decelerate tremendously in reaction to stimuli allowing lightning fast actions. Keen sense of gravity. Consistent athletic build regardless of activity. Super sensitive to pheromone by any source and can identify them. Control of blood. Certain Pain is same as pleasure. Sewers like creek in springtime eating shut like it was shepherds pie. Invasions to the body are assimilated to the body or killed and ejected. As such entering high bacterial environments are beneficial. Hearing is wider than most human such as extreme frequency often attributed to children only. Xmission deathly I'll first then recover

The darkness is not existing to destroy the light but rather strengthen it in battle and the pruning of dead growth.

You are your younger self and just like any person in their youth they dont know themselves or their world well but they are now the most virile in their lives. You susan the younger are needed much more here in this time than any other. That's why you are here in this time and no other. What might that tell you?

Think ye that the gods of good have not defeated The dark goddess in a great battle or some great war that never ends? or that perhaps she seeks to end this world at all? Then know she desires life to continue no less than anyone. Indeed she holds her hand else the world would then truly end. She is both terrible and just with the heart of a mother. It is just as the true gods of death are the most caring of all. Because those places in their charge both living and death lost and grieving are the most needful of any.

Blessing of the undercities democratic leaders


One cannot presume the gods speak with infallable tongue. They may lie as sure as they may speak truthfully but only as it benefits us.

Distance of gods only reflects a stage in the development of man not power derived from worshippers. Same gods same powers same responsibilities. Now man learns his own power and godhood as well as learning how to be responsible to the world in which he exists. Closeness to the gods in earlier aeons was a time when the gods were rearing men like children, an early stage of development. Do not presume the gods to be any less powerful now as ever they were.
