Rape zombie
Bloodborne,  colonized in genitals
Driven to propagate, done by coitus.
Nonfeeder. Heavy requirement of water. Virus slowly consumes host.
Runners
Horde
Strong, male/female

Male to female/male
Transmission by ejaculation, vaginal or anal. secondary infection possible through genital contact with the profuse continual penile discharge. Upon ejaculation infection washes through the body necrotizing major arteries from the point of ejaculation. When infection reaches the brain the subject dies and animation takes place from the viral colony in genital area, the subject now being a zombie. The process takes seconds.


Female to male/female
Rape by female is done through orgasm. Genitals of infected have profuse and continual discharge. Genital contact with discharge could cause secondary infection. When the female reaches climax she convulses rapidly with a massive orgasm and her cervix dialates dramatically. Her viral load is contained in the uterus and upon the opening of the cervix the viral load explodes out covering the males or females entire lower region. Viral penetration takes place through the genital area in particular through the shaft of penis and urethra. If the victim is female the viral load is pushed deep into her genital area and into the vagina often the uterus due to the explosive expulsion of the viral load. Effects are the same as for male zombie infections, arterial necrosis showing through like black spiderweb on the skin, and upon reaching the brain the subject dies and a zombie takes its place. The female zombie is superhuman strong identically to the male. A female zombie can pull down and tape any living male victim.

Discharge for zombie or secondary infection is often tar black for female, or clear for male. Viral loads are always black as tar. Discharge for Secondary infections are almost always clear.

For secondary/latent infections, infection uncommon. Can sometimes identify with heavy genital discharge it varies from heavy to none. the living person would be incapable of releasing a viral load unless the arousal causes them to turn during the event. Propagation by secondary infection through groups is possible and highly likely with sexual partners creating a timebomb in active sexual groups. An epidemic could happen overnight in the right conditions.  If the zombie completes orgasm infection is guaranteed. If it's only genital contact there usually results in a hibernating infection from discharge. It may never fully develop but the greater the arousal the greater the chance of turning if it were to happen. Latent activation of virus causes the same effect as direct infection, the infection spreads from the latent virus in the genital area killing the host and creating a zombie.

Secondary infections often lead to hypersexuality. The infected are immune to normal STDs as the latent infection utterly destroys other infections before they can establish themselves. It also fights off most illness. The virus has hive intelligence and protects its host until it can kill it and take over. Encouraging the host to frequent and varied sexual exploits also increases the chance to spread latent infection.

The normal reaction of the zombie male or female is to pull into their victim hard to cause a deeper and more thorough infection

Zombies without living prey nearby will engage each other sexually by instinct but immediately pursue a living target if it becomes available.

These zombies are virtually indestructable, but are vulnerable to destruction of the genitals.

Condoms are effective in blocking the virus.

After releasing their virus load the zombies are docile but only for a few moments.

These zombies always have their genitals exposed, or at least unrestricted, likely by instinct. Sometimes identified by having no pants but often for females a skirt simply with no panties is not often noticed. They degrade over a period of time but new zombies will have a human appearance, the spider necrosis goes away a little from initial infection but comes back again with every successful infection of a victim as the viral load seems to wash back into the zombies body. These zombies can speak normally. They have all 5 senses within normal human capacity. The zombies are sexual sadists and have little or no other concern than finding their next victim.

susan declines job at ny times in the end to start her own business as an investigator with contracts with midwesern arcane other papers and police consulting which does well because of her popularity from the zombie story.

police contracts start from the prison investigation?

geoffrey was doing research and found things at chichen itza. including the prophesy. susan hears it. ``oh.''.
