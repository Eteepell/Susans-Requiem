We heard screams from the wood. Spook is acting really odd, he seems, narcissistic somehow. I looked into the wood and saw a horror show. They are laughing. Laughing and tearing into each other. Disintegrating each other. Eating each other. That's what the cold was, Spook wasn't casting a distraction he cast some kind of very dark spell. dark enough to turn those soldiers undead!

It took about an hour, far longer than Laura thought but the raiders were cannibalizing each other. The forest became more and more quiet. Spook's eyes became more and more empty as the effect of the black magic he cast took hold. The fellowship warlocks that were infected could cast black magic with impunity but now that they are human every use of black magic causes ever geater corruption and insanity. Human spellcasters have been this way and the white court of wixards have known this. They have wardens whose duty it is to decapitate anyone who even so much as makes a single act of black magic. We  were overlooked simply because we were their allies in the war against red court vampires.  What about now though?

I make my way to Spook. It isn't him who is speaking now, he is trapped inside himself.

I said to Sarg, ``Have you noticed Spook isn't quite right?''

Sarg said, ``I've noticed. I don't know what to think except he needs some sleep. It's been a hell of a haul for all of us.'' Then he spoke out to everyone to board the APC. I took spook aside for a brief feeding in order to try to make a psychic bond with him.

I said telepathically to me people, \textit{``Is everyone OK? We haven't had long to talk.''}

Jill said, \textit{I'm OK. Tired as hell. I'll be glad to get south to safety and rest.''}

The others, in turn, said essentially the same. They hadn't felt any connections to the kills I made. I guess it takes consistency. Maybe it takes willingness. I'm scared for spook. He might get lost inside himself and never come back. I'm his only hope. If I can't come through for him whether it's the wardens or not we are going to need to take off his head. There is no other waty for his own safety and those of others who might be harmed or killed by him in his insanity.

I moved in towards Jill to talk a while. I said, ``I'm sorry Jill I failed you guys. I tried so hard. I had them scared it should have been so easy to take them down.'

``Susan you didn't know they had paranormal ordinance. How could you? There's nothing you could have done.''  

``It doesn't make it right Jill there must have been something more I could have done, you guys took down a dozen of the bastards I couldn't take down half a dozen, and I'm easily ten times the strength and speed of any man.'

``Yeah but you're not counting the women.''

I laughed and said, ``OK. OK girl. I hear ya.''

``It's not about the speed, or the strength Susan. Gotta outsmart them.''

``I tried Jill. I scared them and was going to draw them off but they were so evil I decided to kill them anyway.''

``Then they got to you. It happens.''

``They brought out paranormal ordinance, if I spent more time trying to drive them off it might not have happened. Spook might have been OK. He's falling into dark magic corruption trying to save us. It's my fault. I caused it.''

``Bullshit. Get a hold of yourself Susan. Sarg send Jamar south to guard us and he was wounded all the same.''

``Jamar didn't know enemies were coming rom the south.''

``From where would you request they come?''

``Heh. Yeah. I guess. But Spook?''

``It would have happened eventually. But it happened now. And you're here. Guess what? I didn't feel the connection to the other enemies but Susan I felt spook. Just a little. I think what you believe is a failure may be hope for Spook. You're here now. What if he fell sick from his magic latwer when you weren't here? I believe in you Susan, you can ave him.''
