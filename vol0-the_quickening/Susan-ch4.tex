We heard screams from the wood. Spook is acting really odd, he seems, narcissistic somehow. I looked into the wood and saw a horror show. They are laughing. Laughing and tearing into each other. Disintegrating each other. Eating each other. They enjoyed the taste of each other. They relished the sensation of being consumed by each other. They tore each other apart piece by piece, organ, skin, intestine, blood and ecstacy. They embraced death like a long lost love. That's what the cold was, Spook wasn't casting a distraction he cast some kind of very dark spell. dark enough to turn those soldiers undead!
%sequel. emotion

It took about an hour, far longer than Laura thought but the raiders were cannibalizing each other. They paid no interest in us. The forest became more and more quiet as they died. Spook's eyes became more and more empty as the effect of the black magic he cast took hold. The fellowship warlocks that were infected could cast black magic with impunity but now that they are human every use of black magic causes ever geater corruption and insanity. Human spellcasters have been this way and the white court of wizards have known this. They have wardens whose duty it is to decapitate anyone who even so much as makes a single act of black magic. We  were overlooked simply because we were their allies in the war against red court vampires.  What about now though?

I make my way to Spook. It isn't him who is speaking now, he is trapped inside himself.

I said to Sarg, ``Have you noticed Spook isn't quite right?''

Sarg said, ``I've noticed. I don't know what to think except he needs some sleep. It's been a hell of a haul for all of us.'' Then he spoke out to everyone to board the APC. I took spook aside for a brief feeding in order to try to make a psychic bond with him.

I said telepathically to me people, \textit{``Is everyone OK? We haven't had long to talk.''}

Jill said, \textit{I'm OK. Tired as hell. I'll be glad to get south to safety and rest.''}

The others, in turn, said essentially the same. They hadn't felt any connections to the kills I made. I guess it takes consistency. Maybe it takes willingness. I'm scared for spook. He might get lost inside himself and never come back. I'm his only hope. If I can't come through for him whether it's the wardens or not we are going to need to take off his head. There is no other way for his own safety and those of others who might be harmed or killed by him in his insanity.

I moved in towards Jill to talk a while. I said, ``I'm sorry Jill I failed you guys. I tried so hard. I had them scared it should have been so easy to take them down. Jamar got hurt and I don't know if Spook will ever be the same. He is falling to the corruption of black magic and I don't know if I can save him''

``Susan you didn't know they had paranormal ordinance. How could you? There's nothing you could have done. What happened to Spook would have happened eventually. But it happened now. And you're here. Guess what? I didn't feel the connection to the other enemies but Susan I felt spook. Just a little. I think what you believe is a failure may be hope for Spook. Maybe you can heal him, maybe even galvanize him from the corruption like he was during infection. You're here now. What if he fell sick from his magic later when you weren't here? I believe in you Susan, you can save him.''

``It doesn't make it right Jill there must have been something more I could have done, you guys took down a dozen of the bastards I couldn't take down half a dozen, and I'm easily ten times the strength and speed of any man.'

``Yeah but you're not counting the women.''

I laughed and said, ``OK. OK girl. I hear ya.''

``It's not about the speed, or the strength Susan. Gotta outsmart them.''

``They brought out paranormal ordinance, if I tried to drive them off rather than kill them it might not have happened. Spook might have been OK. He's falling into dark magic corruption trying to save us. It's my fault. I caused it.''

``Bullshit. Get a hold of yourself Susan. Sarg send Jamar south to guard us and he was wounded all the same. Jamar didn't know enemies were coming from the south. He didn't want to get injured anymore than you wanted them to pull out the mordite and come at us. I've lost people in my life too Susan, I could blame myself and get stuck in woulda, coulda, shoulda but that doesn't help anybody. You faced mordite for us Susan, you faced death for our sake. You didn't run away or avoid the danger. To show such courage what more could anyone ask of you? Hindsight is twenty twenty and we learn by our mistakes. You didn't fail us you stood and fought through it all.''

Something took a hold on me. It was like I saw Jill as who she really was for the first time. It wasnt about telepathy, it was deeper than that. She is just such a beautiful soul. She accepts me for who I am; she accepts me for what I am. She's there for me in everything, feeding me, consoling me. I raised my hands to her cheeks and smiled. Then I kissed her; it was a real kiss, a passionate kiss. I took her into my arms and held her tight; held her like there was no tomorrow. I kissed her again and released her, then held her hands intimately. I released no venom, the feelings I was developing displaced my hunger. She was becoming to me something far different than a thrall, and it left me confused.

She said, ``Um, Susan I really don't swing that way. You're my vampire and all and I show you great love but I can't be your mate. At the moment I wish I could but I don't see how.''

I laughed and said, ``Where have I heard that before? I guess the tables have turned hmm?''

She was confused a moment then laughed. Then she said, ``of course, when we first met I tried to draw you close and tempt you by spooning you. You told me then you don't swing that way. If that's right why make a move on me?''

``It's about the feelings I've come to have for you. Maybe it's not love; maybe it's not a crush. Maybe it's a squish. Whatever it is I want to follow how I feel.''

``Well let me think about it. We'll talk at a later time about it. I'm just not ready yet, I'm confused. Let me be your thrall at least for now. I need the healing properties of your venom Susan and if changing our relationship takes that away then we can't. When you made you're move, God help me, you didn't release venom. Need I say that scares the hell out of me.''

I felt so embarrased. I said to Jill, ``I understand. I don't think my feelings will change but I'll let you have as much time as you need.''

She said, ``Thanks. For what it's worth I love you too. Don't feel embarrased. I just need to search my feelings to know what it means to me; I need to understand the consequences of any decision I make.''

%thought
She was absolutely right. I made mistakes but I acted with a lionheart. I didn't hide or run away I moved in and did what I felt was right. We had to flee, but facing mordite weapons there was nothing else anyone could have done. The gods themselves would flee mordite.

%review
We did OK. Jamar is injured but alive. We are all alive. Spook isn't well, his spirit is corrupted. I need to bring him healing somehow. We had to leave behind a lot of our gear when we fled. We now have an APC though.

%analysis
We aren't going to be able to stay out here very long without our rations. We have some on our person but we need to find somewhere to reprovision very soon. This APC has got to keep running, to get us south before we starve. What if our main camp has fallen? What if our people had to relocate? Oh God I hope not, I don't know what we would do.

%planning
Right now I think the most important thing for me to do would be to help Jamar, I can talk to Bones to see what I can do. Spook needs me, Bones can't help him. Noone but me can help him and even then I can't be sure I will be able to rescue him from the darkness that is consuming him. I will try and convince Sarg to let Spook stay with me and my thralls so I can feed my way to a deeper connection with him.

%decision
I'll talk to Sarg tonight to take Spook in with my people. The fellowship soldiers have enough to worry about tactically without worrying about spook so it shouldn't be a problem. I think he is in the most need right now Bones can work with Jamar but it is far beyond his ability to treat Spook in any way.

%action
I go to Sarg, ``I want to take spook into camp with us Sarg, with our people. We have always camped alone together with out own gear and we still need that privacy at night. You have enough tactically to deal with and Spook is a burden to your people in his current state. We can take care of him.''

``Granted. You all can take him but we are going to have to take his head soon, he is going to be a danger to himself and us too. I have a lot greater tolerance than the white council regarding the corruption of black magic but then again warlocks can be life and death for us out here.''

``I think the fellowship as a whole feels that way. Personally I am even more tolerant than before since most of our warlocks don't have the protection offered by the infection.''

``Yeah. I don't know what we are going to do. Assuming the fellowship is going to continue even accepting the warlock refugees from other places in the world may just invite greater danger for the fellowship and others.''

``There are a lot of decisions to be made in the near future. I guess we just continue one day at a time.''

``Yeah. One day at a time. Damn right.''

So I talked to Bones about Jobu.

I said, ``Do you need any help Bones? I'm mostly involved with my own people and we don't have the same military responsibility as you and the other fellowship people.''

``I'm good looking after him at night. We all need sleep though so if you want to have one of your people watch over him so everyone can get better sleep. As it is having the one sentry rotation at night works out well and I would like us all to stick with that.''

``OK, one of us will rotate at night to watch him. How is he anyway?''

``One of his wounds has become infected. Badly infected. He isn't in immediate danger right now but he could get a lot worse very soon. I have him on antibiotics and I'm hoping it will work to cure the infection soon.''

``A personal question, do you have any experience in psychology at all?''

``I was in doctors without borders when I got infected, took remedial training to support the people out here. So yeah. You got issues? Need to seek help?''

``Yeah doc a labotomy and a straightjacket oughtta do me. It's like a. Err\dots{} Kaffkaff, sex thing\dots{}''

``OooOOOoo, having female issues?''

``Not exactly no.''

I go on to explain what is happening with me and my feelings for Jill and how I like guys and not girls so I'm confused.

``Jill you're just biromantic that's all.''

``I am not gay doc I already told you---''

``No no not bisexual, biromantic.''

``That's a thing?''

``Yes thats a thing. Maybe it's the changes in your life since your infection was cured or maybe the curent war or the possibility of resuming your preinfected life. I think something triggered it to surface. It may be fluidity and your romantic orientation changed. Regardless romantic orientation is who you get feelings for, seek companionship and intimacy with and maybe even fall in love with. Just not necessarily having sexual attraction for. It's just how we're wired.''

``Oh I get it. It doesn't make things any easier, it might even make things harder, but it helps knowing.''

``Anytime Susan.''

That night I took a feeding from Spook and had a vision of him. I seen a creature like an octopus attacking him in the darkness. I could see his psyche batting off tentacles. Every once in a while one would pierce his body and he would scream and pull out. Sometimes another would pierce him while he struggled with the first. Then sometimes he couldn't get to one in time and it sank it's barbed tentacle deep inside him and he was powerless to pull it out. Slowly one after another pierced him deeply and the octopus drew in closer slithering the tentacles in deeper and deeper. Parts of his psyche were killed little by little by the tentacles. The tentacles then slowly took over his mind creating anger, jealousy, mania and senseless behaviour. He can't control the parts of him that are dead or dying, under the control of the monster. I drew myself closer and the octopus creature, being somewhat humanoid in appearance, bowed and began to back away and leave him. It meant the creature was tearing out the barbed tentacles. Spook was shrieking at the top of his lungs as his psyche was being ripped apart. At that moment I awoke shaking. Jill and the other thralls were also shaking as well as vomiting from the vision we shared telepathically. We looked at Spook and his eyes were glassy; his mouth was foaming. His hands were clawing at his chest and tore open the skin. We heard him moan in an empty zombie like way. He bit a piece of flesh off his arm and we leapt at him and restrained him with a rope. He was chewing peacefully on the chunk of flesh he tore off. We held a piece of gauze to his arm to stop the bleeding and Craig ran to wake Bones to patch him up.

``Susan we can't leave him to suffer any more. He has gotten far worse tonight and it's clear he is a danger to himself now. I'm going to talk to Sarg in the morning and recommend to him that the time has come to take his head. It was commendable of you to try helping him but there is no cure for the madness that comes from the practise of black magic.''

``I just need more time Bones, we can help him. I only just started to reach him tonight, please don't do this.''

``I'm sorry Susan but my medical opinion stands. He's gone, we need to execute him before he causes harm.''

I need to do something to save him, Bones isn't going to give Spook a chance to recover, no chance for me to heal him. I need to do something to stop this. I know Sarg won't have a choice but to order the execution now that Spook is harming himself.

I nibbled on Spook for those last few hours before sunrise, trying with faint hope to bring him back before we break camp. The soldiers are camped outside under one man tents we found in the APC and me and the thralls are inside. Once we are underway there is no way I can nibble on Spook without getting caught. Oh please Spook get better. Please get better before it's too late.
