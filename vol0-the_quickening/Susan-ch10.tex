\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{L}ater that night after speaking with Laura I gathered the paperwork together and headed back to the research area. I found Jane's tent and see her searching for some papers. I strode in burdened with inglorious purpose. I placed the documents on her desk and stood there facing her. She looked straight at me for a moment then walked from the corner of the tent where she was searching. She looked down at the papers then back to me. Her face reddening.

``What in the blue fuck is this about? What did you do just lift these off the table when I wasn't looking? Who sent you? Colonel Joachim? The general is going to hear about this don't fucking move bitch'', said Jane.

She started moving toward the door of the tent but didn't any more than turn around before I caught her by the waist. She said, ``Get off m---''

I took her fast and pulled her close. My vampire vision came out and she was hypnotized. I could see her aura and life's blood, she was very strong in spirit. She was self sacrificing and relentless. She is very much the hero I hoped she would prove to be. I brought her lips to mine for an intimate kiss. 

This isn't what a person might assume. Venom is quite effective if deposited on the skin but works best if transferred through mucus membranes. The mouth is the most generally accepted target. Other areas vary from slightly more awkward to the kind of place that unless you are really into that person it's, well it's just wrong.

It's what has been called, ``The Kiss'' in the red court. We are actually wired to take down our prey with a kiss, it's in our genes, it excites us.

The moment seemed like an hour, I could feel her succumb to the effect in my arms and it was pulling me to the kill. I gently pulled away from her. I really didn't want to. Dear God that felt so good.

I said, ``You were confused about something hun, where do you say I'm from?''

She said, ``The red court---''

She gasped and wiped her brow from arousal, then leaned gently on her desk to help her keep on her feet. My mouth is drooling with hunger.

She said, ``Why? How are you still here? What are you going to do? Do you want to destroy the only chance these suffering people have to live? You god-forsaken vindictive creatures your empire falls in tatters and you take it out on the sick and helpless. We are going to kill whatever of you are left I swear to God if I'm gone others will come. If you succeed in killing our sick you can be sure we will give you a very painful death.''

She sighed in excitement. I wiped my chin.

I said, ``I suppose that would be what you would think. That's actually not what I had in mi---''

She brushed her fingers through her hair, then threw her head back and moaned. She looked at me intensely and gasped. She said, ``Then what? What could a red possibly want besides revenge? What are you scheming? You damned creatures are always scheming. We are going to find out and we will stop you. Kill me if you like I will never help you, before you enthrall me I will kill myself you can never have me.''

She grabbed a letter opener from the desk, I caught her hand and it dropped. I looked at her like someone who hasn't eaten for a week sees a smoked ham.

She said, ``Just take me. I can't handle this any longer I need you to take me. Just take me now.'' I swooped in for a bit but tore myself away just in time.

She said, ``What's the deal bitch? My blood not red enough for you?''

I said, ``Shut up Jane, ok? Just shut up. I hit you too hard with the venom although just enough given you have such fire. We are getting out of here see? We have somewhere to go. Look at me and tell me if you understand. We have to be quiet and not arouse others interest. Tell me you understand you can be sure I will know if you lie.''

She said, ``Not before you answer me this. I deserve to at least know what your intent is in this.''

I said, ``You said you need venom for the cure. I intend to get you the venom you need to cure all these and any others in need. I'm the only one who can do this for you and unless you chanced to meet another vamp and didn't tell me I think I may be your golden goose so don't you dare fuck this up for yourself.''

Her eyes were the size of golf balls, by her aura she seemed to accept what I'm saying.

I said, ``Do you have some booze?''

She said, ``I think I'm under enough influence right now why would you need booze?''

I said, ``If there's something here for God sake just get it.''

She went to the back of the tent and in a pile of just beside a file cabinet she grabbed a mickey of whiskey in a paper bag.

I said, ``Perfect, let's go.''

We left the tent with her slumped over my shoulder half-paralysed with venom and me kicking back a bottle of whiskey. We passed people by as they shook their head in understanding. Two people passing us said, ``Yup. Told you. She's snapped. Working too hard for too long and I even heard the general has shut her down and reassigned her. Yup, that's what Dave told me yesterday. Seen it coming from afar.''

So we stumbled and dragged ourselves to the back quarter of the encampment close to the embankment. The sentries in this area are placed further up the embankment and all that's here are supplies, with ammo a little further forward. We found one that looks like it hasn't been touched in months. Inside it's still dry and there is metal shelving holding mostly used clothing, both civilian and military. I found a pile of exercise mats in the corner and took some off to put Jane down on.

She said, ``So what's the deal, you going to camp out in this filthy place for me to milk venom? I can do better for you than this shithole nobody knows what you are and I'm not going to tell anyone. You're helping me help thousands who can't help themselves.''

I said, ``I really can't do that. The general is going to search for me eventually after going missing. He may not keep me in the encampment and eventually ship me out which I know for a fact he is going to do soon. I'm a journalist and need to go north eventually to find help and support among those who have it. Besides whatever arrangement you can make is eventually going to be found out anyway and sure as shit the fellowship is going to kill any red they find, probably also those who conspire with them most notably you in this case. Your patients lose not only hope but their most outstanding doctor. Using me to harvest venom is a losing proposition.''

She looked at me, ``You deceived me, I believed you. Why did I believe you? Now you have me here, I'm such a fool. You intended to kill me here to hide the evidence and use the drunken stagger from earlier tonight to make it think it was something I did in my drunken state. Fine go ahead and kill me, give me more venom and make me like it more. Bitch.''

I said, ``Oh no, I told no word of a lie, I do intend you will get the venom you need. Believe every word I told you. Just not from me''

She said, ``You aren't making sense, if you won't give venom then who---''

I said, ``You.''

At that last word I leapt like a tiger. I was on top of her in a split second and drowned her in a deep kiss. Her eyes went a deep as the ocean as waves of venom flowed through her. 

She said, ``No, please, no.'' and gasped. 

She threw her head back and she said, ``Please.''

I dove into her neck and fresh beautiful blood poured into me, my whole body quivered in a new way in response to my intent. Her body became cold and her eyes dead as glass. I shifted to true form and held her in my arms. She is quite dead. Inside my blood meal is stirring. I feel myself beginning to heave. My body is incubating my seed into my bloodmeal. The excitement is building in me as the moment comes. I lock my lips with hers and deliver our life back to her. I see her eyes open pure black. I wrapped my wings around her and held her tight. My seed is consuming her etheric body and looking down on her aura I can see the completion of the infection as she releases a hiss for the first time. My first baby girl as a vampire. What will she be like? She didn't regain consciousness for an hour, or at least functioning. She laid there still, her eyes large and black would occasionally blink. Honestly, I thought my firstborne turned out a bit wrong until she spoke.

She said, ``Hungry. Want food.''

I said, ``I don't think you need food dear. I'll be here until you gain your senses and can decide that for yourself.''

She sniffed the air and looked around like an animal, ``Smells good, out there, there.'' and she pointed to the main area of the encampment.

I said, ``I know dear. It smells good.''

I sang a lullaby to try to take her mind off her change. After a while she said, ``Where am I?''

I said, ``Jane? Can you hear me?''

She said, ``Who, who are you? Where am I?''

I said, ``Jane my name is Susan, we are in a supplies tent at the back of the encampment.''

She said, ``Why? What am I doing out here? What's wrong with my eyes things look funny.''

I said, ``Stay with me a while. I'll look after you just relax Jane while things start to come together.''

She said, ``I feel a hunger, I've felt this before not so long ago. Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong.''

I said, ``It's all wrong Jane, there ain't nothing right here.''

She said, ``That's damn straight. I'll take you up on it, I'll rest here a while.''

\parasep

She said, ``Bloodlust? Oh Christ I remember, you fucking whore goddammit you fucking turned me you fuck---''

She looked up at me, she said, ``Oh.''

I said, ``Yeah, oh.'' as I gave my wings a shake and tucked them behind.

She said, ``What team am I playing for now? What's the color?''

I told her of the events so far from \chichenitza* until now.

She said, ``Sounds like we used to be the red court.''

I said, ``Don't even say that. We have some red court genes.''

She said, ``I like that better. Still have the half turned stage as well, you left me half-turned.''

I said, ``I left it your choice what path you wanted to take from here. I feel it's your right to choose.''

She said, ``You're right, and you took that away when you didn't explain what you had in mind. I don't want to be back in the position of infected. No fellowship member would.''

I said, ``If I did you wouldn't have gone through with it, I know that.''

She said, ``You're right. We might have still found venom at some old encampment though. Now it doesn't matter what's done is done. I understand your reasons, but I want you to stay away from me. When you leave this place don't come back I don't want to see or hear from you again.''

At that she left. I hope this was the right choice; that I should turn her; that it was her who should be turned first; That she should have been turned at all. May God have mercy on us all if I have chosen wrongly.
