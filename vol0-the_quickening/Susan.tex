\chapter*{Dedication to Queen Lilith}
{Bear with me here, \textit{Queen Lilith is the actual god and queen of vampires}. The real one. 
	
I've done some research as I went along, what writer doesn't. I was creatively inspired to write about what happened to Susan on the alter of \chichenitza*. How she stood against the odds and will change the world for the better. The story of a hero who just happens to be a vampire physically. Somebody decent, with a dangerous side. I started it two or three months ago.

I've avoided looking too much into vampire lore. The reason being I believed it would be horrible, mean and nasty. Either in the horror sense or in the campy sense. That isn't what I wanted to show in Susan. Neither maniacal nor glittery. I wanted to break the mold of vampire novels and not write a vampire novel. I would write about an antihero trying to make a positive difference in the world without brooding a lot. I wanted to show strength, confidence, determination, responsibility, and someone protective and nurturing. A female hero that stands alone. A female hero that can be truly intimidating, and lay down some serious kick ass when it needs to be done.

About a month ago or a little longer I had a rather forgettable experience in seeing a praying mantis under a case I had put down. I had never seen a praying mantis before that I can remember, I thought it was pretty cool. How it got there was a mystery there was nothing but concrete floor ten feet around me. I should think I would have seen it, but who knows. I felt bad for the little creature so I picked it up. It wrapped it's arms around my finger and squeezed, snuggling it's head against the finger. I thought that was very odd, but not having been around the creatures I presumed it was frightened and that's just what they did to stop from falling. I was honestly afraid it would bite me but it never did. I let it go into a bush to the side of the concrete platform.

There is a feeling I am getting familiar with, something in the heart. A spiritual equivalent to being slapped in the face a few times. The d\ae mons aren't subtle. Something that day on a webpage had a passing mention of Lilith and Lamashtu. The mention of the praying mantis as the sacred animal grabbed my attention immediately. I read her biography in response. Then I found her. I found Susan, as I had already written her.

Oh I didn't find a goddess that looked the same, although she certainly is gorgeous. She didn't have an underground palace that I've read. Perhaps she has a sexy smirk but what mattered was Lilith is a wife and mother. A feminist. Confident and strong. Nurturing but viscous and powerful when defending her family.
	
She has many titles. Queen of Night and Darkness, Queen of Vampires, Lady Lilith, The Dark Mother. She likes different kinds of flowers including roses. She likes sandalwood incense. Her favourite fruit is pomegranate, and she loves chocolate.

At least one occultist who, as they say, worked with her, calls her an amazing lady.

She, like Susan, was human once. She was the first woman. You see, women did not actually come from Adams rib. At least not the first. Lilith and Adam were both created from the dust to be each others companion. Adam preferred for her to be obedient to him and she preferred to have an equal partner and when that didn't work out she left. God only knows where she went but along the way she met Sam\ae l and they have been inseparable ever since.

She is the worlds first polyamorous woman. Sam\ae l may be her primary so to speak but she has had many lovers. Unlike the accusations of her being a whore though she genuinely loves those she is with and is quite happy, her and Sam\ae l are still together so they are an example of a successful polyamorous relationship.

She is a fierce advocate of women's sexuality, she enjoys sex with both men and women(not physically I assume, she's a d\ae mon), so as a result is an LGBT advocate. I'm sure that she is a 3rd generation feminist. She protects pregnant women and children. She is a healer. Although she heals through the feminine current she heals both men and women, especially with self image.

She is drop dead gorgeous. Everyone who sees her sees her differently but the description I was given makes her sound like an irish sex god. Long wavy red hair, pale skin and red lips, deep emerald green eyes, perfect body. She either wears nothing or majestic see through clothing.

What I have said I have said. There is such a conflicting mess in the field of demonology. Lilith likely has a dozen names at least. Her three most popular are Lilith, Lamia and Lamashtu. Sure they could be different entities but Lamashtu for one was described as being the daughter of heaven. In the context given it meant that God created her from nothing, as opposed to coming from man or woman. That has to be Lilith. 

Why is Lilith often described as evil incarnate? Sexually liberated feminist women and LGBT people are discriminated against now, whether they were Gods or not how would people have treated them or spoken of them in 1000BC or even before? People are so quick to see monsters around them, if only they would spend that time looking for the monsters inside themselves.

\chapter*{Prologue}
{Not everyone is a Dresden Files fan so not everyone is going to know who Susan is or what she's been through. This series is going to be an independent endeavour from the Dresden Files proper so once her background is explained here it will be easier to get into the following story. She was very much a main character in the first three books, then disappeared until death masks skipping a book. There were six books before she had a major role in changes only to die at the end by Harry's own hand. Her hopes ended.\\

So here goes:\\

Susan and Harry met when she arranged an interview on the opening of his business as a professional wizard in Chicago. It was a couple years before the Storm Front novel. She was a reporter for the Midwest Arcane at the time which was a supernatural version of today's tabloid with stories like ``JFK’s Mutant Ghost Abducts Shapeshifting Girl Scout.'' Little did people know from time to time the stories were real! Susan even went into syndication.

She had a tendancy to hound Harry for a good story although she had an alterior romantic motive, and made no attempt to hide it. Of course her romantic expression served her well in getting information as well.

She was attractive, bright, appealing, her motivations were clear and simple, and she was honest in pursuing them. She was absolutely relentless. She was charming, gorgeous, funny, and sexy as hell. She used her sexuality in pursuit of information. She is very aggressive and was the one to ask Harry to dinner. Yes Susan took Harry out for their first date and treated him. She had a smile all her own, sultry, sexy, intelligent, and appealing. She had a patent smirk with her lips quirking up at the corners. Her hair was midnight black, with dark eyes and a deeply tan complexion.

The first three books were completely Susan. She could easily have been the other primary protagonist as far as I was concerned.

In Storm Front she asked Harry out for dinner. Well, kinda tricked him into dinner in a playful way. She wants what and who she wants and works hard to get it. After she and Harry ran into a demon they needed to combat. A toad creature. They did it but barely, Susan vomiting most of the time from potions Harry had her drink. The date turned out to be the worst night of Susan's life. As well as the best story she had written so far. End of story.

In Fool Moon, the second book in the series, her appearances gained speed until about half way through the book she took the drivers seat. Literally. Getting Harry out of the mess he got himself in as well as being the driver for him and those he needed her to drive for. Including some young werewolves. Susan saved the day in this novel and Harry was along for the ride.

In Grave Peril Harry was about to marry Susan though it wasn't apparent until near the end. They are still dating heavily and very serious. She had her first sight of vampires in this book, but not her last. Harry got an invitation to a ball by a local vampire that just got promoted to the nobility. Susan forged an invitation to get in with Harry. Harry had protection under the accords but she didn't because she was never really invited. This particular vampire held him accountable for the deaths of two people she loved. Vampires being what they are in the Dresden series she swore to dedicate her life to exacting vengeance against Harry in one way or another. She found a perfect way. She knew about him and Susan so she stole Susan away and ``turned'' her. Basically this ended their relationship because Susan was walking a tight rope from that point on, she hungered but if she ever fed she would complete her change and become something else. No more Susan. For now, denying her hunger, she could survive and live as a human but arousal, exhaustion, or the smell of blood, or a number of other things might cause her to lose it and make a kill then game over.

That was the last we seen Susan, she did not have a part in the next novel but in the following one she did reappear briefly. She had been fighting the vampires in south america and doing humanitarian aid to the residents there. They followed a high ranking vampire back to Chicago (where the novels take place). She gathered her belongings from the city to take back home and intervened against the plans of the vampires while there. Harry and Susan got to fight again and went to a ball together. They even had a dance together. Then she left to rejoin the fight in central and south america.

It was seven novels of wondering what happened to Susan and when she was going to find the cure for her vampirism. In that final novel ``Changes'' she fights with Harry to save the daughter they had together (that he didn't even know existed). In the end of the novel Susan makes that first kill and begins to change. Their daughter was saved from being killed in a sacrifice and Susan was killed in her place.

That is where the Dresden files story ends and the Susan's Requiem story begins. Her life will never be the same.
