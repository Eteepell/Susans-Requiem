\chapter*{Preface}
{Susan's story has it's own unique character. She is her own woman now. Her story is raunchy, brutal and vulgar. I am a daemonolater in the real world, a practitioner of the actual left hand path. Think religion, like Wicca meets ACDC. I hope it adds a unique creative quality to her dark story.

Not specifically mentioned in Susan's background I see her as a quiet unassuming type, an innocent nature balanced by an overwhelming passion that couldn't be quenched.\\

Harry once said to her:

\quote{“I am pure of heart and mind,” I told her. “I cannot be corrupted.”}

I believe he meant her, while jovially saying it about himself. It helps show evidence for her incorruptable soul. She dreams of peace and understanding between the human and vampire species and unsurpassed honor among vampires. She demands they take a share of her own nature. She has become an excellent soldier with courage to face and kill any enemy directly without guilt but she is a journalist and prefers more strategic approaches. She is extremely intelligent.

\chapter*{Introduction}
{Losing Susan Rodriguez hurt. As a result I decided to spinoff off the character. Susan returns full circle back to being the annoying journalist she was. She will struggle with her past, find healing, and adjust to the dark new world she is entering into. She will find ways to be there for her daughter while she navigates through her own existential crisis. Over time she will be unveiling the extraordinary and magickal (note the K at the end) of our own world under the guise of the ancient and forgotten.

\chapter*{Background of Susan}
{Not everyone is a Dresden Files fan so not everyone is going to know who Susan is or what she's been through. This series is going to be an independent endeavour from the Dresden Files proper so once her background is explained here it will be easier to get into the following story. She was very much a main character in the first three books, then disappeared until death masks skipping a book. There were six books before she had a major role in changes only to die at the end by Harry's own hand. Her hopes ended.

So here goes:\\
	\smallskip
Susan and Harry met when she arranged an interview on the opening of his business as a professional wizard in Chicago. It was a couple years before the Storm Front novel. She was a reporter for the Midwest Arcane at the time which was a supernatural version of today's tabloid with stories like ``JFK’s Mutant Ghost Abducts Shapeshifting Girl Scout.'' Little did people know from time to time the stories were real! Susan even went into syndication.

She had a tendancy to hound Harry for a good story although she had an alterior romantic motive, and made no attempt to hide it. Of course her romantic expression served her well in getting information as well.

She was attractive, bright, appealing, her motivations were clear and simple, and she was honest in pursuing them. She was absolutely relentless. She was charming, gorgeous, funny, and sexy as hell. She used her sexuality in pursuit of information. She is very aggressive and was the one to ask Harry to dinner. Yes Susan took Harry out for their first date and treated him. 

She had a smile all her own, sultry, sexy, intelligent, and appealing. She had a patent smirk with her lips quirking up at the corners. Her hair was midnight black, with dark eyes and a deeply tan complexion.
