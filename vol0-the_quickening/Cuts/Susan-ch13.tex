\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{H}ow's it going with Harry so far Ebenezer asked me. Heh.

``Do you mind if I called you Abe? I just think you deserve a pet name somehow.''

``Damned women. I have no problem with that.''

``I'm going to be away from Harry for a while Abe while I look for my boyfriend Steve, Will and Georgia are going to help me out. Not to make Harry sound like he's disabled or anything I just don't know if he can reasonably say whether I've been to visit or not you know?''

``Yeah I hear ya lass. No problems. Good luck on the search, let me know if I can do anything.''

``Definitely will Abe.''

So we go back to the old headquarters which is now a smoking ruin. Will thinks it is doubtful he will be able to find anything but he is going to try. I give him and georgia some of Steve's things and they're off. They sniff around for quite some time, narrow in on a patch of floor where I last seen him and ``woof.'' me over to the location. Some dried blood on the floor. We follow it to one of the cross-building catwalks. It leads into one of the adjacent buildings that is nothing but undisturbed dust. Steve's footprints can be seen entering the area, and meeting another set of footprints that are seen exiting the same way. A cloth is seen on the ground, and what looks like a small skeleton key. Will and Georgia carefully check that area out and go human again.

``Well, the blood is definitely Steve's. He came here and the cloth had ether on it so he was knocked out. The key is probably from handcuffs or shackles I've seen it before. There is a little grey piece of cloth right there where something, maybe the shackles, had caught it. See there?''

``Yes, I do. Is that relevant?''

``Very much, I know that fabric from Harry, it's from a wardens cape.''

``Oh fucking shit, wardens are involved somehow. I was taken in to an inquiry recently. I'll bet he was, or is, going to be under inquiry soon too. Thanks a million guys that's the start I needed I'll get a hold of Abe.''

``Hey no problem Susan you're cool. We hope you can stop by for a visit again soon.''

``Me too, I just need to try and stay out of the spotlight so I have a chance for a more normal life rather than being some bent version of Clark Kent.''

``We're werewolves. We can totally relate to the double life dramas girl.''

``Don't I know it.''

So they were off. Big start there I love them dearly for that. I get hold of Abe and he has no idea what the fuck is going on, using milder words than he did. I ask Mab if I could travel the ways to Edinburgh again. She gave me an immediate yes. So off I go to meet Abe at main headquarters again. He seems mad as a hatter, which I think bodes well for him being on the up and up with me. We grab something to eat, I arrange for a room on the surface to stay in and we both go into his chambers at the white counsel headquarters.

``What do you think is happening Abe?''

``Somebody doesn't like the regulation of respecting god entities. Somebody wants to use their lovers against them, likely interrogation. Just whatever they can get away with. Somebody wants to find what you aren't telling.''

``Well I'm nervous they might find out about really kinky sex fetishes we have together but other than that I've got nothing to hide.''

Abe chokes, ``Yeah, well, er, nothin' I need to know lass.''

``So we're here, where to?''

``The young ones. They be asked anything by their elders they should have a story to tell. Thems that I know like Injun Joe should be open 'nuff too.''
