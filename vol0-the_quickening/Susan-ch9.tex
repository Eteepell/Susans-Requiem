\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{Q}\space uietly in the still of the night we circle each other again, this time in human form.

I said, ``Why do you stalk me? What am I to you?''

He said, ``You are me sister though you do not know me.''

I said, ``I have no family. I have no brother. A fine brother you would be to do battle with your supposed sister anyway.''

He said, ``Hah, a d\ae mon is always ready for battle my sister. As above so below, existance is a struggle, the clash of swords, the victory and the defeat. The way of war is the way of life and of our existence for we are existence.''

He stood at ease and raised his hands palm up.

He said, ``Will you stand down my sister and hear my wisdom?''

I stood easy and slowly opened my palms, my kabar resting easily in my open palm. Slowly I returned my blade to my sheath and we stood facing each other. I'm still very much on edge.

I said, ``Speak.''

He said, ``I am Leviathan. I am d\ae mon. I am not the Leviathan of evil legend, I am not that same creature. Me and my kind bear accursed names but we are spirits replete with wisdom. I am the d\ae mon of water. In this I am no god of water I am water. I am the very element made manifest. You are d\ae mon also. As long as creation has been and as long as it will be so also will there be the d\ae monic for we are creation. You and your power are one. You are the d\ae mon of darkness; you are the reason men fear the dark. The events of \chichenitza{} were a quickening. A catalyst as it were, to bring you forth in power.

``I needed to speak to your grown aspect, to do so I needed to weaken you enough to cause her to come forth so I battled with you. You are beloved to me Susan, and I am at peace with you now.''

I said, ``You're long winded dude. So basically you say I'll be fine. I just need some schooling. Oh and I got some serious juice. So what if I fuck up and like blow the world up?''

He said, ``The d\ae monic weren't meant to dwell here. Be careful. We are watching over you, so you have license to be confident we can help you mop up most messes.''

I said, ``Most... messes?''

``Most.''

``That inspires confidence.''

I decided to nickname him Levi. It helps me differentiate him from the biblical reference and it's just easier all around. I guess I got more juice than an east German female powerlifter. Not that I know what I'm doing yet. Give a kid some nitro glycerin and tell them not to blow themselves up. Good idea. Fucking \chichenitza{}.

In the afternoon of the next day we arrive at camp. It became apparent that the tents were full of victims addicted to venom. The bad ones. Just like any bad drug some people are more susceptable to addictions than others. Some life-threatening in fact if the drug were removed too quickly. These are the bad cases. Many are restrained. Many show signs of blown voice boxes from screaming. Most are cadaverous from not eating and limited intravenous because they thrash too much to keep the iv in. It's like hell on earth. Fucking red court vampires.

A familiar face came running up to me. Geoffrey, from the house of Windsor in the UK. Anotherwards a member of the royal family.

When the reds were still around some British representatives were present here. In one of the fellowship raids I freed them when they were held hostage. It was in our best interest to clue in the monarchy and get their support in our resistance. So we took the risk to free them and send them back with some fangs procured from dying reds. Needless to say they clued in and we had support that was desperately needed.

He said, ``Lady Rodriguez, it has been a long time. I see things are changed but not better here. It is a travesty the people of central and south America are so relentlessly afflicted. Pray God should have mercy on these suffering souls.''

Oh yeah. I was knighted for my courage by the queen in a fairly secret manner. It doesn't change anything in my day to day life so I often forget the fact.

I said, ``Wassup Geoffrey?''

He said, ``I'm acting as an attache to the queen. She wants to know what is happening down here. Her wizards reported a massive release of black magic some time ago. I'm told the reds were consumed in the release and the fellowship here reported a truely historic event at \chichenitza{}. Needless to say it was assumed you were burnt to dust. I'm glad you are well but what happened to you?''

I said, ``I woke up with the world's worst hangover.''

He said, ``ok. You could just say you don't know. There's no reason to always drip sarcasm you know.''

I grunted.

He said, ``Well, anyway. I'm looking to take the first flight out to report back are you leaving north I assume? Your journalistic ways are less uaeful down here than educating the northerners on this tragedy.''

I said, ``Exactly my thought. I'll need to figure out how to get noticed but I need to drum up support from up north somehow.''

We met the base commander, a general Kraghstrom. He let us know in no uncertain terms there is no free ride here. Resources are low and everyone either has a purpose or has to leave. Although everyone else is retained for sentry duty he advised me my journalistic background makes me first pick for a mission north. An outbreak of zombies seems to be underway and it carries the risk of apocalypse if it is viral based.

That night I walked among the tents and considered these latest events. I laid plans to achieve my goals.

This could move me closer to having enough clout to be heard up north if I can report something credible. Nobody north of Mexico will believe raw stories of demons and zombies. Something believable is what I need. That will carry my message to the eyes of those whose support we need most.

I can get closer to my Harry; I can get closer to my daughter. I am always her mom in my heart and I need to be close to her but am I still her mom in body? I've undergone a tremendous physical change that goes far beyond what I could ever understand. Oh little Maggie, your mother is dead, long live your mother.

I heard a noise toward the medical tents. Instinctively I move toward the sound, and continue to ponder to myself.

I am the darkness Levi said. How zen is that. He is the water. Well I must be the sarcasm also.
