\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{S}o what the hell do they want to hear? I just decide to start with a realistic description of what we are. I said, ``We're refugees for God's sake! Mercy, leave us be!''

``Well don't you have brass balls. I would believe it from these quivering wretches but you are something else. You a merc? I think so. I have no use for rogue red court assassins. Your masters are gone, now you die murderer.''

%scene disaster
Veronica leaps up to defend me, ``No! Don't hurt her!'' Crack! Literally the shot heard around the world she took an AK round through the temple. She was dead before she hit the ground. My friends all screamed and jumped to her.

One of the gunmen said, ``Cease fire, these poor wretches have been through enough. This woman is a problem, she could kill a hundred before she falls.''

The gunman raised his rifle and said, ``Stay on mission.'' The others repeated, ``Stay on mission.'' The motto of the fellowship. I found them.

I said,

%transition
The gunmen immediately click on the safeties of their rifles, and lower weapons. The one gunman said, ``Now that is something that never got far from any base camp. Sorry ma'am it's hell out here. What's your name?''

I said, ``Susan\dots{} Corporal Susan Rodriguez.''

He said, ``Well good to see a sister out here Susan, I feel like shit about that woman I'm so sorry people. We don't know who are friends from who are enemies out here.''

Jill said, ``You fucking monster, does she look like a threat? What the hell could she have done?''

The gunman said, ``Quite a lot. If she had a pistol, or worse explosive ordinance she could have taken one or all of us down quick.''

I said, ``Doesn't make it right bud. You know my name what is yours?''

He said, ``Sargeant Miller, Dwight Miller. Everyone calls me Sarg.''

I said, ``Well Sarg, just so you know, we're all tight here and would be quick to lay down our lives for each other. We don't know you yet, I would like some private time with my friends here so we can decide what to do next.''

Sarg said, ``Granted. You take what time you need. We are going to make camp here for the night. We've been in cover for hours here observing you all and we are tired. Especially tired given we killed an innocent today.''

I said, ``I hear you. We'll debrief in the morning then as to where we go from here.''

Sarg said, ``You are welcome to travel with us if you decide so. We are heading south to find base camp, if it is still there. Most of the fireteams I've met up with are doing the same. We need to regroup and figure out our place in this new world.''

I said, ``Thanks Sarg, I'll let you know.''

\parasep

%sequel emotion
``I am not going to go anywhere with those assholes. We'll roll on our own, I would rather fall on my sword than travel with them.''

Vinnie said, ``I will believe to get us to be loved in a jerk or will be lived love during when they are far. For spectacles believe they fear. A jerk or by far. Lots by far. Lots spectacular. I will by want us in. Want us to get ass cheeks.''

I smirk, and roll my eyes.

We were gathered around in an area not too far from our campsite, far enough away from the soldiers we hopefully won't be heard easily. Without the vampire part of the fellowship, the infection, it's much easier to say we are out of earshot. The infected or half vampires like I was had supernatural hearing nearly as good as full red court vampires.

%sequel - thought
Veronica said, ``The more of us the more chance some manner of contagion might invade the group. I vote nay, we go it alone.''

I said, ``It would be safer, we would have a better chance of getting somewhere safe. It only makes sense.''

Jill said, ``Oh yeah, so we should believe the one who lethally fed off our friend Daniel? Sucked him dry, I seen you. I know. We all know. Here we are and you wont damn well touch us.''

I sat there feeling surreal. This is what I worst feared. They knew.

Craig said, ``Great. Thanks Jill that helped. Now we're going to lose our vampire and along with her all hope of getting better.''

I said, ``Hello, I'm right here. I have a name you know. I didn't think you knew about Daniel, I'm so sorry. I know saying I was hungry doesn't help much. I guess I wish I could have munched a bad guy there just weren't any around right then. That didn't come out right sorry.''

Jill said, ``No there is no good way to say it. I know you didn't mean anything by it Susan it's just the way you are. You need to feed soon though or you are going to kill again. I've lived with reds long enough to know, you need to accept us or you will kill again. It's your nature. I love that nature, please be the vampire you are it is a noble and beautiful thing.'' She grabs her fang necklace and holds it tenderly.

I sat there thinking. She's right. The soldiers killed today to defend themselves but my hunger is worsening and it will eventually make me kill to feed. The soldiers had no choice but I do. I can't keep on starving myself. I have to have enough wisdom to realize if I'm stubborn and blind to the reality of my new nature I will kill again and again. I need to eat a regular diet so I don't gorge myself. Just like anyone.

I sat there a moment. Then I looked at them and I said, ``OK, I'll try. I only know to kill though. I refuse to feed in the hope I wouldn't need to and then I just end up killing from hunger. I've never fed normally. I don't even know if I have venom, at least not the kind you need. I'm sorry guys I don't know for sure what I am, I'm scared. I'm scared that I am a monster more horrific than any of the reds could be.''

Jack said, ``You're a vamp. I don't know how you could be a daywalker after only having risen a few days. Maybe you have amnesia, you're old but can't remember. You're just a red though, you drink blood. I don't care what Jill said, wings and talons and such. She tells long tales.''

I look at Jack and raise my arms. I give him a little smirk in the hope he is not going to attack me and then I extend my talons. Everyone except Jill jumps back. Jack pulls up his fists then backs down. Everyone looks at Jill. Jill said, ``I told you. It's all true she took on that thing, changed to some kind of vengeful angel and drove it off. There's her talons like I said. It was all true.''

I said, ``If you want me to try feeding I will. You can see now I'm not any red that any of us have ever seen. I'm not the same. So you know feeding is a risk. I still say we need to join the soldiers. It's not about whether they are worthy or not, it is not about what happened to Veronica. She would not like us putting ourselves in danger just in stubborn defiance especially for the sake of her memory. You know that. I'm starting to realize my abstinence has been putting your lives in danger too. So if I'm taking the risk with feeding, please take the risk in joining with the soldiers. These are fellowship soldiers, not mercs. It's not for sure we are safe with them, they may have forsaken their oath but at least the fellowship \textit{has} an oath.''

%decision
Laura finally piped in and said, ``I agree. These soldiers give us an excellent strategic advantage in our plans. I will follow them. The odds are well placed. It is less likely they will betray us than other men of war and that possibility weighs well against the tactical defensibility they would provide.''

Jill said, ``Agreed then. We follow them. Let's camp for the night. Laura it's your turn to tantilize the vampire.''

Vinnie chuckled, then said, ``Provide for the lift of the need to cause food. If takes for Life and heinous food, in the chef nutty nutty nutty impact. Heals needs thy Food, nutritious for lift of thrones ornate food, nutty Food. To top the need for methyl of their cough, if youth for continuous.''

Laura said, ``Understood.''

I snorted a laugh.

Then I let out a kind of maniacal giggle, thinking of willingly taking thralls. I'm not entirely able to accept the reality quite yet. I have thralls. Whether or not I choose to feed from them they will follow me. Jesus. I have thralls.\\

That night Laura snuggled up to me. I nuzzled her for a while, slobbering on her like a dog. She started giggling and moaning, when she started falling limp I was aroused to feed big time. Then I just let go and bit and fed from Laura. She let out a deep gasp and moaned intensely in pleasure. I heard Jill from the other side of the tent, ``Thank God. It's about time.''

Vinnie said, ``Thunder cheese.''

\parasep

%action
I let the Sarg know we decided to accompany them. He made the order to make ready to escort the refugees south with them to freedom. Or hopefully so.

We started out. Laura had no interest in world domination today. She looked like a teenage girl in love. She would steal glances at me from time to time and was just generally in her own happy place. I'm not one to talk though, I felt the same. When we made camp for lunch that day we sat together. I noticed the venom caused a vampiric reaction on her skin searing it. I cooled it with a rag and some water. She is going to make sure to cover her neck and upper torso from the sun to protect herself.

``I should have known better. The venom always kinda turns skin vampiric. It's just been so long since I've provided to my master.'' she giggled, ``you were wonderful Susan thank you.''

She snuggled in with me as the lunch was being cooked at the fire and I felt a rush of joy go through me from her touch. Like that being young and in love feeling. It was great. It made no sense. I just don't care, it feels so innocent and wonderful. I held her close and kissed her tenderly on the cheek. I love this.

Everyone seen us, and we made no attempt to hide anything. My friends, or, thralls, were looking very confused. I heard one soldier say to Sarg, ``Uh, Sarg. I think our new corporal is. Uh. You know. Like playing for the other te---''

``They look happy. I'm glad. How much longer for lunch, how are our rations\dots{}''

Jill came up to us and asked Laura, ``Girl, does it feel the same? Is the venom as it should be?''

Laura said, ``Perfect, feels exactly the same. Exactly what we need Jill, Susan's a keeper for sure.''

Jill said, ``Uh Susan, you're acting a little bit different from what you should. What are you feeling right now?''

I told her what I could about how I felt.

Jill said, ``Susan have you ever been fed on, ever?''

I said, ``No, I just got turned as far as I remember.''

Jill said, ``It's just that what you're feeling mirror the effects of the venom with only a few differences. What happened at the turning?''

I said, ``Dear God. Well if you want to know grab something to vomit in.''

So I proceeded to recollect my experience of the turning, and my thoughts about it.

\begin{quote}
		``The turning. I could probably turn someone too, it's an instinct, I just never tried or had the interest yet. 
	
	``My experience was very intimate. My clothes were torn and my body exposed, then Bianca in true form took me into her arms and caressed me, sliming me with her bodies excretions. That is, that slime they excrete like sweat in their true form. She continued massaging the fluid into me, and started cuddling me intimately. She drank from me, until I was delirious and near death. She savoured the taste of my blood for an eternity while my delirium worsened. I was nearly passing out probably from blood loss. I seen something change in her face, a kind of ecstatic release I guess. She rose up from me and her body started heaving. She leaned toward me like she was going to give me a kiss. Her claws sunk deep into my back immobilizing me. When our lips connected she started vomiting directly into me. It felt like worms inside me and I seen writhing beneath my skin. The feeling passed as she cuddled me. As the wormy sensation dissipated my senses seemed to just awaken as if all my life they were merely sleeping for lack of a better word. The dark room became like twilight. I was still confused and semi conscious from the lack of blood which I guess was returned to me when she regurgitated in me but I couldn't snap out of it. The bloodlust was there right away too but I didn't know what it was. I was thrown into a room, my love Harry was thrown in after. I nearly killed him but he snapped me out of it, the rest is history.''

\end{quote}	

Jill held a hand to her mouth and looked a little green. She said, ``Oh Jesus. I didn't know it happened like that. My God that's disgusting. They threw your beau in the room for you to eat? Who pissed off the red you or him?''

I said, ``Him. He is good at pissing people off.''

She said, ``God, were they ever vindictive. I'm so glad they're gone. I want them back again but not like that. If only they could be the noble creatures I know they are deep down. Like you. You're definitely a keeper Susan you're a sweetheart.'' She smiled and rubbed her fang necklace, snuggling it to her cheek.

I said, ``I already killed two people Jill, your friend and some random dude driving down a road. I don't think sweetheart applies.''

She said, ``All things are relative. They were really awful, you aren't. You are still a vampire Susan. A predator of humans. Apparently the definition of thrall with you has become a human who dedicates themselves to the proper feeding, care and protection of a vampire. What a brave new world it is.''

We talked for a while, and came to the conclusion that I've established a telepathic link to Laura and am sharing her pleasure. Nonetheless at the time of feeding I still had to contend with the mania, until it settled into this sense of connectedness. We noticed a difference, my connection to Laura showed a dominant aspect. I want to protect her. She wants to please me. There is a bond of love between us. George said it was the natural thrall relationship of love restored. He said that it is based on the trust of a big strong wonderful vampire. He said me and Laura are going to have a beautiful and eternally loving relationship. That's George, he sure has a flair for the dramatic.

\parasep

After a few days had gone by, I have had a feed from all the thralls. We all feel interconnected and on top of the world. We have a telepathic bond of some sort. The soldiers are suspicious but can't seem to put their finger on it, or at least we haven't been confronted. 

%scene
We heard a hell of a racket close to camp, everybody leapt up and me and Craig were cleaning ourselves up feverishly from a feeding. Jill and Laura helped. He was intoxicated and fell back to the sleep roll. We explained to the soldiers he hasn't felt well tonight. Sarg is worried we might need to stay camped an extra day, or drag a stretcher tomorrow.

Sarg said, ``Who's on sentry?''

I said, ``Jack. Oh God Jack.''

I heard gasps from my thralls behind me.

Craig said, ``He'll be fine. He is getting his senses back now.''

Everybody looked straight at Craig, then the thralls looked at me, and all raised eyebrows and smiled.

Jill said, ``It's working.''

Sarg said, ``What? What's working?''

Jill said, ``The increased fibre in my diet, I'm more regular now.''

Sarg said, ``What the flying fuck does that have to do with anything? Nevermind, you clowns stay here. Grab your gear men and get ready to engage.''

%sequel
It was getting quiet as soon as the soldier left. Soon we heard the call, ``OK people, it's safe to exit the tent. Conan the barbarian butchered some Jaguars.''

I said, ``Pardon?''

Me and the thralls left and headed to where the soldiers are. Jaguars? Plural? The hell? We seen quite the sight. It definately looked like a Frank Frazetta sketch. Jack took down six fricking jaguars with fist and kabar. His shirt and pants were torn and his massive bodybuilder physique shined. Blood trickled from his breast with what injuries he had taken. I turned my eyes away from him, between the trickling blood and that outrageous body I was getting two or three different kinds of hungry.

Jack said, ``I was cool in the fight. I'm not berserking anymore. I was hungry for the battle, and fought with strength and skill, but my wits were about me. I'm me again. Thank God, and thank you Susan. Thank you so much.''

Sarg said, ``For what? What is he tha---''

I said, ``---Sarg, all things considered do you \textit{really} want to know?''

Sarg said, ``No. Actually no, that'll do just fine.''

I said, ``Sarg, I'm moving up with you and your boys. Jaguars aside our own personal X-man Wolverine can take care of the thr--- er, civilians.''

Sarg said, ``Granted. It will be good working with you.''

%scene
We need to keep moving south quietly. The last thing we need is to have some hostile force come down on us due to some territorial bullshit. Soon after that thought a bullet hit a tree and we hit the dirt. We need to take care of this quickly. I found my telepathic link to the thralls was strong now, strong enough for open communication.

I said telepathically, \textit{``Hit the dirt people, we have inbound fire here.''}

Jack said, \textit{``Damn. Hear you loud and clear. Bloody amazing. Everybody Down!''}

Everybody answered in their minds tongue. I listen, the road. It's 500 yards out, I hear a vehicle. I said, ``Stay down Sarg, I'm gonna look.''

Sarg said, ``Aye.''

It's an APC, about a dozen soldiers around it. Looks like militia but they are probably raiders.

I said, ``Sarg, looks like a dozen. Irregular troops, trained civies. An APC also. If you don't have anything I have a 20mm rifle with incendiary rounds for the APC.''

Jack transmitted by thought, and said \textit{``I have movement due south of us Susan. Sounds like a rabbit but if there is something up there it could very well be hostiles down here also.''}

I said, ``I hear you Jack, I'll listen to see what it is.''

``There is something in the bushes around out people Sarg, I might be able to find out what it is.'' I said to Sarg.

Sarg said, ``How the hell do you know that? Never mind. Do your shit.''

I listen 150 yards away, where the thralls are, and I hear something like a housecat, moving silently. Or almost so. I squint my eyes in concentration and hear the breathing. A large animal. I hear a whisper, ``Alpha tango, target appears to be refugees. I see nothing of value except supplies.'' I don't hear the reply but in the bush the voice of the hostile soldier returns, ``Aye, order understood.''

I said to Sarg, ``They're checking us out, it sounds like raiders. They may not realize our people are distant from us. I believe they may think our people are the whole of our contingent when the troops on the road fired at us thinking we were the same group. This may work to our advantage if they don't know there are organized fellowship soldiers within reach. I say we start to move back slowly Sarg, I will try and gather more intel on the way.''

Sarg said, ``What the fuck are you using for intel woman? You got some cybernetic implants I don't know about? We are going to have a real come to Jesus conversation soon if you don't come clean. Agreed, we stealth south to our people.''

Another shot hit an inch from the soldier Jamar's head. The force on the road is trying to keep us down. Likely it's in order to allow the team south of our people to make their strike.
