\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{S}o what the hell do they want to hear? I just decide to start with a realistic description of what we are. I said, ``We're refugees for God's sake! Mercy, leave us be!''

``Well don't you have brass balls. I would believe it from these quivering wretches but you are something else. You a merc? I think so. I have no use for rogue red court assassins. Your masters are gone, now you die murderer.''

%scene disaster
Veronica leaps up to defend me, ``No! Don't hurt her!'' Crack! Literally the shot heard around the world she took an AK round through the temple. She was dead before she hit the ground. My friends all screamed and jumped to her.

One of the gunmen said, ``Cease fire, these poor wretches have been through enough. This woman is a problem, she could kill a hundred before she falls.''

The gunman raised his rifle and said, ``Stay on mission.'' The others repeated, ``Stay on mission.'' The motto of the fellowship. I found them.

I said,

%transition
The gunmen immediately click on the safeties of their rifles, and lower weapons. The one gunman said, ``Now that is something that never got far from any base camp. Sorry ma'am it's hell out here. What's your name?''

I said, ``Susan\dots{} Corporal Susan Rodriguez.''

He said, ``Well good to see a sister out here Susan, I feel like shit about that woman I'm so sorry people. We don't know who are friends from who are enemies out here.''

Jill said, ``You fucking monster, does she look like a threat? What the hell could she have done?''

The gunman said, ``Quite a lot. If she had a pistol, or worse explosive ordinance she could have taken one or all of us down quick.''

I said, ``Doesn't make it right bud. You know my name what is yours?''

He said, ``Sargeant Miller, Dwight Miller. Everyone calls me Sarg.''

I said, ``Well Sarg, just so you know, we're all tight here and would be quick to lay down our lives for each other. We don't know you yet, I would like some private time with my friends here so we can decide what to do next.''

Sarg said, ``Granted. You take what time you need. We are going to make camp here for the night. We've been in cover for hours here observing you all and we are tired. Especially tired given we killed an innocent today.''

I said, ``I hear you. We'll debrief in the morning then as to where we go from here.''

Sarg said, ``You are welcome to travel with us if you decide so. We are heading south to find base camp, if it is still there. Most of the fireteams I've met up with are doing the same. We need to regroup and figure out our place in this new world.''

I said, ``Thanks Sarg, I'll let you know.''

%sequel emotion
``I am not going to go anywhere with those assholes. We'll roll on our own, I would rather fall on my sword than travel with them.''

We were gathered around in an area not too far from our campsite, far enough away from the soldiers we hopefully won't be heard easily. Without the vampire part of the fellowship, the infection, it's much easier to say we are out of earshot. The infected or half vampires like I was had supernatural hearing nearly as good as full red court vampires. It has been coming and going with me but when I hear well I hear very very well. I'm quite shook up right now and feel deaf as a bat. Pardon the pun.

%sequel thought - review
I said, ``It would be safer, we would have a better chance of getting somewhere safe. It only makes sense.''

Jill said, ``Oh yeah, so we should believe the one who lethally fed off our friend Daniel? Sucked him dry, I seen you. I know. We all know. Here we are and you wont damn well touch us.''

I sat there feeling like the world was surreal. This is what I worst feared.

Craig said, ``Great. Thanks Jill that helped. Now we're going to lose our vampire and along with her all hope of getting better.''

George said, ``I'm always scared. Always panicky. Always. I had hope our vampire would help us and after a time she would have to. They get hungry. Now I doubt she's going to stay thanks to Jill. Face it Veronica was a bitch. Venom or no venom I can't see her suddenly acquiring a kind streak.''

I said, ``Hello, I'm right here. You can talk to me I'm like in the room so to speak. I didn't think you knew about Daniel, I'm so sorry. I know saying I was hungry doesn't help much. I guess I wish I could have munched a bad guy there just weren't any around right then. That didn't come out right sorry.''

Jill said, ``No there is no good way to say it. I know you didn't mean anything by it Susan it's just the way you are. You need to feed soon though or you are going to kill again. I've lived with reds long enough to know, you need to accept us or you will kill again. It's your nature.''

I sat there for a while. She's right. The soldiers killed today to defend themselves but my hunger is worsening. I'll soon kill myself. I can't keep on starving myself or I will kill again and again. I have to have enough wisdom to realize if I'm stubborn and blind to the reality of my new nature I will kill again and again. I need to eat a regular diet so I don't gorge myself. Just like anyone.

I sat there a moment. Then I looked at them and I said, ``OK, I'll try. I only know to kill though. I refuse to feed in the hope I wouldn't need to and then I just end up killing from hunger. I've never fed normally. I don't even know if I have venom, at least not the kind you need. I'm sorry guys I don't know for sure what I am, I'm scared. I'm scared that I am a monster more horrific than any of the reds could be.''

Jack said, ``You're a vamp. I don't know how you could be a daywalker after only having risen a few days. Maybe you have amnesia, you're old but can't remember. You're just a red though, you drink blood. I don't care what Jill said. She tells long tales.''

I look at Jack and raise my arms. I give him a little smirk in the hope he is not going to attack me and then I extend my talons. Everyone except Jill jumps back. Jack pulls up his fists then backs down. Everyone looks at Jill. Jill said, ``I told you. It's all true she took on that thing, changed to some kind of vengeful angel and drove it off. There's her talons like I said. It was all true.''

I said, ``If you want me to try I will, I still say we need to join the soldiers. It's not about whether they are worthy or not, it is not about what happened to Veronica. She would not like us putting ourselves in danger just in stubborn defiance especially for the sake of her memory. You know that. These are fellowship soldiers, not mercs. It's not for sure we are safe with them, they may have forsaken their oath but at least the fellowship \textit{has} an oath.''

Laura finally piped in and said, ``I agree. These soldiers give us an excellent strategic advantage in our plans. I will follow them. The odds are well placed. It is less likely they will betray us than other men of war and that possibility weighs well against the tactical defensibility they would provide.''

George said, ``I love you so much Laura, you are like the bodyguard and I am the princess. You are so wonderful.''

``Mastermind, my dear george. One destined to conquer.''

George said, ``aww. How sweet.''

Laura shook her head in frustration.

Jill said, ``agreed then. We follow them. Let's camp for the night. Laura it's your turn to tantilize the vampire.''

Laura said, ``Understood.''

I let out a kind of maniacal giggle, not entirely able to accept my reality quite yet. I have thralls. Whether or not I choose to feed from them they will follow me. Jesus. I have thralls.\\

That night Laura snuggled up to me. I just let go and fed from her, slobbering like a dog. Laura let out a giggle, gasping and moaning in pleasure. I heard Jill from the other side of the tent, ``Thank God. It's about time.''

\parasep

I let the Sarg know we decided to accompany them. He made the order to make ready to escort the refugees south with them to freedom. Or hopefully so.

We started out. Laura had no interest in world domination today. She looked like a teenage girl in love. She would steal glances at me from time to time and was just generally in her own happy place. I'm not one to talk though, I felt the same.
