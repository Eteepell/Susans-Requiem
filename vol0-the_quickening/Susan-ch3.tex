\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{I}t seemed like such a long trip back to William's town. It's just time to rock and I want to get there like now, right now is a good time lets not drive and just be there now snap fingers and just be there. Oh well, no such luck. I kinda wish I had wings, but maybe I shouldn't wish with my luck I have a true form that can fly like a dragon breathing fire and everything. Gotta get me fixed somehow.

So I reviewed my case notes so far. One of the highest etheric content is found in sprouting seeds. Bang, there's where the seeds come in. Found nothing about thresholds so either the books just never mentioned it or this creature is unaffected by thresholds. I'm guessing the latter, I am in a sense my own example where I have a component of vampire in me but I'm not effected by thresholds. I hope I don't have to go in Jorge's house again it took 3 fricking days for that full body itching to stop. 3 days. hells bells. 

Aye and I'm dressed to kill at that, well actually I'm dressed to do a valve job. I have no clothes so I borrow what Carlos has since we are about the same size and he works with a railroad company. I'm Francisca's size too but the ankle long dresses she wears wouldn't do me much good for the life I lead. Further check of the case notes, my checklist. Need to ask William about running water for the innocent to run through if needed. Hopefully there's a stream. As for me there is that most gruesome red court vampire half that might help, garlic, and some steely knives so that I just might kill the beast. 

So our first stop is going to be Miguel's to find out more about that shaman. We need to find him to find the body. There's nothing we can do to destroy the revenant unless we destroy the body. The most we could do is use our knowledge to assist the families in warding off the revenant indefinately and that is not good enough for me. I would shame myself to submit such an article.

After we arrive at Miguel's house he answers that question, ``I see the shaman at midnight to the north of the cemetary, over there,'' 

He points to the cemetary which is west of his house past Jorge who is directly east of the boneyard. 

``He works some magic over himself and walks into the cemetary. Some nights I see him come out when I have trouble sleeping, usually around 3AM. I always assumed he was blessing the dead of the ancestors to assist them home. It usually happens every night.'' 

Wierd. I haven't a clue what this dude is doing out there. I'm guessing he ain't no shaman. ``I'm going to go meet this supposed shaman tonight, is it OK if my guys stay with you tonight Miguel?'' 

``Yes of course, they aren't going with you?'' 

``Better not. Between the war experience and the journalistic experience I'll be fine, more than one person could unsettle him or bring us attention we don't need. I'll go alone.'' Besides I don't want to vamp out or worse lose one or more fellows I need them to take care of me. I could see Carlos about to raise an objection. Miguel turned and I hopped, pointed to Miguel, pointed to my eyes, pointed to my fangs. Miguel coughed but he got the hint. Miguel or anyone else for that matter need not see me vamp out I'd be lynched in such a religious town fairly immediately.

``As a matter of fact Miguel, maybe we could get the preacher to advise residents to stay in tonight for the exact same reason'' and all Carlos had to say was an agreeable ``mmhmm'' like what can you say really without letting the cat out of the bag? 

I actually headed out about 1PM with a sandwich and fruit that Miguel prepared so that I could munch and get a look at the area alone from a journalist perspective. I need to find a roost to snap some photos, take notes, unobserved. Then I'll move in all friendly and see if I can find out more about who this dude is and what he is doing. Hopefully it works out but if not I need to know where cover is so I can dive and a route to get away fast. Done this stuff before no biggie for me, shown be cut and dry. The area is quite residential with midrise apartment buildings and homes on single acre lots. The homes aren't big but they are in good shape, the people that live here are working for a decent wage. The cemetary is unfenced. To the south side is a cliff with a single treacherous path leading down to more recent graves below. I went down and verified none of the graves are less than a year old, newest is about 50 years old. It makes a difference because my material indicates life as a revenant is hard and most don't live more than a year. Down here I see where a lot of garbage has been dumped over a long time, which is an abomination to have strewn across this section of graveyard. It seems to be an island though heavy equipment seems to roll through here often and I see a railway line not 50 feet away through overgrown brush. The machinery must be working on the line, this section is under constant use even up to present the ground is completely dug up. There are some coloured banners on the trees and brush in this area which I am presuming is due to the construction, power lines, gas lines, graves and so on. On the cliff face I see 2 or 3 tomb entrances but I don't see how on God's green earth one would gain access to them. Perhaps there was a way at one time but the path was washed away. Moving back up the cliff at the top is a caretakers shed. It's locked but a look in the windows says it's not worth the time having someone unopen it I see nothing of interest. There are pathways leading throughout the cemetary, this top area is a victorian garden style which is very nice and maintained. I don't see anthing more to say about it here. The church is actually on the cemetary property but is properly attached to the main street and not inside the cemetary. Assumably the church owns the boneyard but I have nothing actually saying that's true.

I looked in the area Miguel pointed out and I do see the remains of a ritual being worked. I can't tell if it's ancient magick or modern magic that uses the magical current such as wizards like Harry uses. I don't know enough about magick to see the difference. Of what I do see is the circle was made with salt given that it tastes salty. Don't judge me I was pretty sure it wasn't deadly poison. Well fairly sure. There are burn marks and the remains of unknown components. I guess suffice it to say somun dun magics 'ere.

OK so immediately north of me is a small park area, a home to the east and a midrise 6 story to the west. Searching the park I find nothing, well besides cut grass, trees and bushes. Which is where I found a nice roost, actually in one of the bushes there is a depression where I can lie below ground level completely eaten up by this bush. It's a glorious find.

The plan is then to do a full 7 hour meditation. It's longer than usual but it's 4PM now and that takes me to 11PM. I'll start my stakeout then in case he arrives early and go from there. I'm thinking since the cemetary is unused it's likely the lower area the the revenants body is resting. It looks like a jungle down there. This guy is probably doing some kind of residual magic and passing not into the cemetary but through it and descending to the lower level to do whatever it is he is doing. When I confront him he should fumble through excuses but I know he will drop some manner of clue for me to follow up on. I have to try and wait for the right time. Before he finishes the ritual in case it is a protective one I may not get a chance to get near him then. I'll use my more sensitive half vampire hearing and write down what I can. Which reminds me I should put together a red or blue flashlight it doesn't look like there are any lights at all and it calls for a pitch black night tonight. Miguel should have something I can use for a stealth flashlight.

I went to miguels and scored big on the flashlight, got a military surplus flashlight with the detachable coloured filters. Absolutely perfect, clip and everything totally handsfree if I set it up right. When I was in the city I wondered about decking out in military gear to make stakeouts easier, but in the city is does just the opposite. Imagine a guy walking down the street or in the park in army fatigues and gear. Stick out much? yeah I think so. I've heard of journalist using the SEP method though. Dressing so insanely that people turn away and pay no notice of them. It stands for "Somebody Elses Problem" and aptly named.

Meditation was restful. I can't sleep as a matter of nature currently so until I can heal that part of myself I just simply meditate. It works very well for me so far breaking the day and creating the recharge time. Unfortuately meditation is when my visions come. And this night was no different. And I still can't be sure what they mean. Yet I am still sure they are of a diabolical nature.

So again this night visions revisit her, this time more vivid than before, more detailed.

She sees a workshop, reds and humans alike. Alchemists and scribes working. The red king, and one ringwraith? That guy needs to reconsider his fashion sense that kind of thing is munchkinwear. They are discussing a spell. The bloodline curse. 

``Good afternoon, it appears our spell is near completion. We certainly appreciate your interest in this matter''

``Certainly. It is in our best interest to see you win this war, You clearly will do so at any cost.''

``We won't be shamed by our enemies, we engaged in our pursuit too soon and did not gain the momentum necessary for victory, that needs to be rectified. This is one step forward towards that goal.''

``And brilliant dear king, no matter what happens you win.''

``In my mind although his daughters sacrifice would bestow the power of Harry's bloodline to her there would be few to be consumed by the spell.''

``But if Harry should save his daughter,''

The red king replies, ``Irrelevant. A child inherits the power of a pitiful few. Ariana is pleased but our victory is still uncertain. Absolute world domination ever less so. The key is the one named Martin. His hate has consumed him. Although he assumed he has deceived me I am the master of deceit. He will throw himself down to be fed, his hatred is too great to choose to feed and to turn. He will make himself food. Even if he does feed we still have victory with him as the heir to the red court. Truly any red court vampire sacrificed will ascend. Ariana would be most pleased to see his lover as the full red court heir of course, to see the subjugation of this world under her will and might. Imagine the distillation of the power of the entire red court upon the one, the vicious, ruthless, conqueror and true red court heir.''

``Yes king, the new red court will be vast. She will propogate quickly and be mighty indeed. And I will be pleased to have such an ally. I shall be the one who created the way to ascension of the ruler of the world''

Susan stirred conscious for a moment. ``Heh, somebody really fricked up. I may not know what I am but I know ruthless conqueror does not fit the bill. I think these visions are closer to dreams. I guess I shouldn't pay so much attention to them anymore. I'm just so self-conscious and unsure after my ordeal, I just need to give myself some time. Well a couple hours left I'll go back into my meditation.

Multi-voice again, ``The foolssss, it wasss too ssssoon. That which wasss human is asssscended human that which wasss vampire is assscended vampire. You are who you are not, You are not who you are, fusion of human and vampire asss one. Our sssissster come. Our sssissster join usss.''
Susan interjects unashamedly in her semi-conscious state, ``Oh shutup I'm meditating here.''
``Yesss, do enjoy''
``I am thank you''
How polite the demons are. Such a refreshing change seriously. I think I can get control of these visions just need to be firm but polite. No prob.

Soon enough along comes the shaman. I see the lights coming from the distance and sweeping. He's coming straight toward me! Ah hell gotta move quick, if I wait it's all the more likely he'll notice me. I roll quick out of the hole I'm in and behind a tree. After waiting for the sweep of his flashlight to move to the other side I dive for a nearby tree large enough to stay hidden behind. After wiping the sweat from my brow I watch him slowly moving by. Once he gets to the street I see him cast a circle and place some food into a triangular ``circle''. I see a semi corporeal object that looks like a meat sack appear and descending on the food. Oh God ew, for an invisible entity it sure looks rather visible now. It must be growing stronger. Once the  creature was feeding the shaman moved from the circle into the cemetary. I'm thinking to myself was he really so much feeding the creature as distracting it to avoid being it's meal himself? I wait until the shaman is well into the  cemetary before I launch up and head for the cemetary behind him, checking I have my garlic secure on my person first of course. Once past the entity his flashlight flicks off. Damn. I move quick and fall twice to get closer. Closing the distance slower now I see a light shining below the cliff and I realize that the light didn't go out as much as the shaman is descending the cliff. I move quickly to just beyond the edge of the cliff to see when he fully descends and is occupied. I'll be damned if I'm gonna scare him off when he sees my light right behind him.

He descends slowly. I have no idea who figured it was a good idea to expand a graveyard off the edge of a cliff with little more than a goat trail going down. It makes me wonder again about the crypts that poke out the middle of the cliff. Likely there were goat trails to those too before there wasn't. 

When he reached bottom he shone the light back up again. I'm glad I didn't go down too soon he would've run for sure. I see the light flicker over the graves and then out past them into the rough area. He seems to have located what he was looking for there. I was about to head down when he turned around and shone the light at the cliff. He pulls something  out and I see the glint of a shovel. Sure then, is he about to bury his the troubles or pop open a cold one?

When he is back at the rough area I decide it's time for me to slip quietly down. 

``Whoops, crap!'' Susan slips on the edge of the cliff and the next thing she knows two balls of fire are heading her way. The first one slams loudly into the edge of the cliff where she is standing melting it into glass and the other hits her square in her left side. Involuntarily a low growl like a half ton tiger comes from her and she falls and lands soundlessly like a cat 50 feet away. Brutally injured she falls to the ground. half her torso is missing and her left arm is gone. ``Jesus, why am i not dead?'' Her wound is bloodless and her flesh black and necrotic. The sound of writhing black larva comes from her side and she sees herself quickly regenerating via what appears to be a massive larval mass. ``eeeew'' she exclaims.

The flashlight moves closer to her and she is thinking to herself still immobilized from injury, ``egad I wish I could just make like smoke and float away''. The flashlight lands on her but with a hiss she dissipates into a light fog, glowing eyes show forth to the shaman for an instant and are gone. The same involuntary growl comes from her but now seeming to come from every direction. The shaman is terrified.

``Holy hells David, any other sorcerer on this planet would hit a mortal but you would have to hurl fire into some nasty ass demon you fricking idiot. What the hell were you thinking at least wait until you see what you're aiming for. Now you're dead you poor dumb bastard''

Susan ponders, ``It hurt like hell but listen to this guy spill, almost worth it. Almost. Ouch.''

``Abram and his dumbass ideas, I can be a revenant and find divinity in myself through immortality. All you have to do is bring me the proper sustenance. Oh Abram you greedy bastard sustenance was not enough you needed the ethereal energy of human beings didn't you? It was so unnecessary but you did it and brought attention to yourself and likely me too. Apparently also this nasty ass demon. Oh you bastard. I dug you a hole, a crypt for all time but screw you. You uninhibited S.O.B. figure it out yourself I'm outta here, see you in hell.''

He scrambles up the cliff and I let him go. To hell with it there is no earthly law that would convict him for what he did although I hope he repays this debt in the hereafter. I located the body in perfect preservation exactly where David the sorcerer was in the rough brush, covered in a tarp. The freshly dug crypt, earthen dug into the soft cliff face and lined with stone. Abrams organs were in a jar in the crypt already and his body mummified ready to be placed. I reached for my journal out of instinct and my body solidified. Completely healed. I figured I will freak out over that later no time at the present. This is perfectly according to my research. So that's why the victims weren't killed, the revenant had no need of their energy. David executed the plan perfectly. Abram was just greedy. Too bad for him the townspeople are going to burn this corpse on a pire, no more revenant. I stayed and meditated in the brush until morning light for safety. That very morning the townspeople cremated that corpse and me and my boys were on our way home.

We passed by the cabin on the way through and I typed up the story from my journal and sent it to the arcanes securebox using tails. I also sent a bitcoin address hoping to get some payment for my work on the story. They came through in spades the payment was massive. As a matter of fact I yelled and did a nose to floor fistpump ``yessssss!''

Finally, with permission of the diocese and a good word from the pastor the basilica got rebuilt and my home became what it should be. I have internet now! Life is good. My library has significantly expanded, magick temple, kitchen, living room, alchemy lab, awesomeness. Even the crypt was cleaned up and renovated. It's now accessible from outside cut off from the rest of the basilica. The women of the village place flowers at the tombs every Sunday after mass. It's good to see.

My heart got the better of me when I got back home and I called father Forthill in Chicago worried about Maggie and wondering how Harry is doing. Of course father didn't believe it was me and all I got was that Maggie is safe and happy and Harry is at least still breathing. We both knew that's all we could ask of Harry. Poor bastard. He deserves a happy life. I left him father Antonio as a forwarding contact and wished him well before we hungup. I can't visit, but at least I know they are alive and Maggie is happy. I couldn't ask for anything more. I told father Antonio if father Forthill does ever call he is a family friend and to speak openly.

Well the demons have picked tomorrow morning for us to have our BBQ. It will be good to meet them. In as much as it is good to meet demons I guess. I certainly have a lot questions. The confrontation with David really emphasized how little I know about myself.
