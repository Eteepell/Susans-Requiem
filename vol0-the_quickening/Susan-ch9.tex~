\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{I}\space went out tonight with my friends from the times. It is great to get out and party again, meet new people, and have some laughs. I see something mighty fine at the bar, I walk up, and offer him a drink. Hey, it's the 21st century women can walk up, grab them, and take them home now. Besides i'm about as courageous as they come. He accepts my company with a smile. He introduces himself as Steve and he is passing through town. This little pub is a rather classy one so I wasn't surprised that he is a neurologist by trade. This guy is pretty awesome I haven't laughed so much in a long time and oh my god he's gorgeous. I wanted to drag him to my place by his shirt collar but easy there Susan. We did dinally leave for some coffee where we could talk in a quieter more comfortable environment. I made some little hints then went with taking his hands in mine and smiling ear to ear. He got the point. We leaned in for a kiss and it was wonderful. He doesn't look enthralled. I dropped a fork so I could check his aura and be sure. He has the heart of an angel, and is overflowing with life force. Oh yummy. I drooled, shook my head to pull back the romantic mood and he hands back my fork. I'm looking right into his eyes, into deep pools of passion, so masculine and strong. He radiates confidence and I dont need my sight to know it. I take him with my hands behind his head and draw him into a powerful deep kiss. 

``Wow! Susan you have a real fire in you! Did you want leave for somewhere private? a casual walk in Central park?'' 

``Yeah, my place or yours?''

``Whoa, easy tiger, what about yours? I mean I'm staying in a hotel. It's kinda small and really hotels seem to invite a cheapness to any romantic rendezvous don't you think? I always want to make that real connection with someone.''

``Well I only got an office desk slash bunkbed but I'm going to say this plainly. I'm starving to make that real connection so unless you have an objection I'm throwing down an exercise mat and my bearskin rug right in front of my crackling fireplace and declare it ready for lovin' ''

``Holy crap!''

``Steve i work for one of the worlds most prestigious newspapers. I have an excellent salary and i work hard for every penny. I don't get much time to myself much less for romance and i think in your work you understand what that means.''

``Yeah i do, it's just that i'm not the kind of guy that can normally move that fast. I just don't feel comfortable without that deeper connection.''

``Fine steve. Tell you what, I take you home. We get comfortable and we'll keep right on getting to know each other. We do that while I eat you for supper figuratively speaking and whatever happens happens and what doesn't happen is fine by me get it?''

``Yowzas, OK, I'm in.''

``Good let's blow this place.''

The place we were at was right close to work and I live in hells kitchen. Steve's in no rush so we walked, took us some time but it gives him a chance to make that connection with me. It's been fucking years for me I'm gonna make a real connection with this guy in an entirely different kind of way. I'm needing him bad. Even the last time with Harry I was half turned and I was so sick with the hunger he had me tied up so i didn't drink him dry. It was a release but i hope and pray this time the hunger doesn't keep me from properly expressing my human sexuality.

We get to my place and there's a bit of a chill. I move the two lounge chairs away from the fire and get it started. I go in the closet and practically hurl the exercise mats down, the bearskin rug and some cushions. In the same manner I practically hurl Steve down on the mat then vault into the air to land hard right beside him.

``Sooo travelling make you sore? Need some massaging maybe? If you just want to talk that's ok too I got you here and we got all night all to ourselves.'' I flick his nose and giggle. He laughs hard, i don't think he's been in a situation like this before. I have to admit it's ridiculous, and enough to scare and intimidate a lot of men. Men are people, just like us women are, and i know how I'd feel. Well, players aside. He needs to get calm and comfortable, laugh, and have fun. I told him it didn't matter how much he's able to participate and from a self-confidence perspective it doesn't. There's nothing i need to prove to myself. From a human perspective though I want to give him every opportunity to be comfortable and express himself also when we play. It's just about decency to try to have an experience that can fully be shared, my last sexual encounter with Harry we had no choice but to restrain me, before that encounter I thought my sexuality would never find any release living infected with vampirism as I was just to dangerous to chance it.

``No no I'm ok, just maybe give me a few minutes''

I scared him.

``Steve, as in literally, if you're sore I'll massage you and I would enjoy doing that for you. For it's own sake.''

``Oh I'm sorry i didn't mean to misread you.''

Yup, scared. He has depth, a big heart, and deep respect for women. One of the elusive nice guys. I take his hands in mine.

``Ok steve, I'm about as forward as they come. I'm one of the good women though and I can see you're scared. You don't need to overthink that statement and presume it's an insult it's not. You're just human, a really decent guy and uncomfortable opening up very quickly. So this is what I think we should do. I have some massage oils so I'm going to give you a massage all right? We can chat and anytime you like we can switch.''

Yeah that's the trouble with nice guys. They could be army war heros strong and brave it's how they interact with women. They are suited well for marriage, family, sickness health and so on. These aren't girly men, maybe shy but not cowardly. When he finds love and marries he's going to love and abide his wife unfailingly to the grave. I think therefore it is lucky i found him now so i can enjoy fucking him before someone takes him off the market. So i go and get the oils leaving my clothes behind. I gently undress him, cuddle him and pretty soon he's returning the tenderness. I begin rubbing his shoulders, gently kissing his neck from time to time. It's quiet, we are just communicating by touch, and what we are saying to each other just seem much more understandable than with words. I massage his middle back and i can feel the tension subsiding. He sighs. I'm expressing patience and adoration to him. What i was trying to say in words he is finally understanding by touch. This is no hit and run sexual encounter I'm keeping him right here to enjoy. He turns to me and i can see he is much more comfortable. He takes my head into his hands and draws me closer. We share tender kisses together and look into each others eyes. We know the need in each other now. Sometimes you can see a soul through a persons eyes but it is no soulgaze. You see in the other yourself like through a hazy mirror. We are all the same beneath the flesh, every human soul and it's deepest part is the same as another. We both work difficult jobs and our need is the same. We want and need to express ourselves sexually and at this moment in the unfathomable depths of his deep blue eyes I see him, and I see me, and I see we have found each other tonight. Almost instantly the fire of our needs ignite and he rolls me to the mat, he is on top of me and all i can think is let yourself go Steve, don't think just let it happen, dear god Steve let go. He goes down to suckle at my breast and i take a peek through my sight. I can see he's getting hot all right. Not fair to peek like this but i want to see if anything wrong is happening like a release of my venom into him. Still all clear thank god. I havent tasted that viscous venom so far I guess my body produces it as an emotional response. Dear god he's making me hot. I throw him passionately, but gently, onto the mat and start exploring his body with my lips. I can feel him quiver beneath me. Oh he tastes good. Working up i run my hands over that hairy chest and feel his pulse race. Oh i can smell that racing pulse smells good. Shit. Frick frick frick. I pull him right into me and I'm absolutely quivering with thirst, sucking my venom back in my mouth fangs hanging low as an indy car, eyes black as a coal mine. Christ what to do, what to do. He rolls me  back down i close my eyes, pull my mouth closed and keep swallowing back venom like a glass of water. He goes down on me. Whoosh my reaction was immediate. He's the best i've ever known who have this skill. The bloodthirst converted back to raw passion and I was getting hot. Way hot. My vampiric senses were kicking in more the hotter i got giving even more sensual feedback sending me higher. To put it simply sex after my change so far is many magnitudes better than it had been as a straight human. 

Oh I need to taste those beautiful lips of his again, I rise up and kiss deeply and passionately I'm losing control and it feels so good. I draw back with his sweet taste on my lips my eyes closed. My heart is racing I look into his eyes. 

His eyes have no iris and he is pale as a ghost. I'm inadvertently drawing life energy from him white court style. 

Fuck fuck fuck Susan give it back holy christ! 

During one of those knee jerk moments I do the impossible and start seeping the life energy back into him. I'm holding his mouth wide open to make sure he drinks deep. Using my vampire vision, now that i know i can do this reversal skill I top him back where he should be. I gasp hard and bring him into a gentle kiss, he pulls back from me and his eyes are back to normal. I push him gently back to the mat and resume kissing and nibbling on his neck. ``oh my god susan after that last kiss my senses have come alive, i can feel everything magnitudes better, it's amazing, you're amazing!'' Urk, I transferred my superhuman senses to him! Aargh! Without a word i come down beside him and just hold him. 

``Susan are you ok?''

``steve i am, but i feel it too. I'm just taking a break, want a beer?''

``Yeah that was pretty powerful. You're shaking and your eyes look like saucers. You do need a break i can tell. sounds great.''

Need a break? Oh Steve you have no idea thank god. That was like a movie, earnest goes to fuck. I tested him for increased sensory perception on our break and he was normal. I'm getting reschooled on how to fuck. Watch out for a sweet taste that's drawing life force directly like white court, stay focused and dont drift into blood hunger, my body reacts accordingly. stimulate stimulate stimulate is the answer. My increased senses take on a whole new meaning when it comes to sensitive. I can release his life energy back to him when we are intense we share our enhanced sensitivity sexually, maybe more. This makes one think about how i get cadaverous when i dont feed at all, solid or otherwise. That's Like a black court thing. I'm sharing aspects from different courts. Ok enough Susan you got a gorgeous guy here to play with so drink the beer with him and go play. Ain't nothing wrong when you're both having some good xlean fun.

So i experimemted. I don't know if it was fair to Steve. Rather dangerous in fact. A bit of a walk on the wild side. The white court propogates by normal human means. They fuck, conceive, then pop out babies. They don't turn. The aspect i have is blowing a kind of vampireform on Steve. The more i feed him the thicker the haze is on his aura. It disipates when i stop feeding him after a while or quickly if i get far enough away from him. The vampire form protects him from infection, sorry it was a huge risk but i took it and there you are. In a sense it protects him from vampiric death, if we do walk on the wild side neither one of us is going to kill the other. I mean talk about a mood breaker. It keeps me out of bloodlust too, yay! That vampireform veils the human blood. Not to say the vampiric expression of passion done safely is anything but erotic it just means that expression is an erotic expression and not bloodlust. Oh, one other small thing. That mask prevents specific details from being memorable. He remembered bites and nibbles shared but the roars, black eyes and fangs, ferocity and bloodletting. I told him we were covered in naturopathic massage oil, i let the broken furnature stand though. He's got to have some stories to take back. Steve took me to school tonight, I learned about sex all over again. Gonna go get more of that. Nice guys only please.

``Thanks for cleaning up that massage oil Steve, that stuff can stain.''

``Susan i swear that looks like blood. I don't remember any massage like this.''

``Steve we've been pretty intense, I don't have any holes in me do you?''

``You're right. It's just been intense.''

``Beer then round five?''

``Oh god yeah, i'm about ready for more now. So much energy and excitement!''

``Oh i know Steve, your my man tonight in ways you can't know.''

Get that sweet ass on over here. I've not had any let it go and get it on sex in years. Haven't had any manly booty at all restrained or otherwise. I put a little more wood on the fire. He grabs me from behind and I laugh, I'm loving this. He draws in for a deep kiss. I pull him into my hips and he rolls down on me. I feel the penetration and squeal as he goes at me hard. I roll over on top and tease him. Just slowly stimulating him to make him a little hungry. He rolls me forward with a ravenous kiss and teases me back with slow stimulation. I'm screaming, I'm going over the top, i land on him hard and begin kissing slow and deep. I'm stimulating him slowly and consistently. Then i take him deep. I'm navigating my passions well now. We're fucking slowly, I'm holding control while our hunger builds. I smile and purr. I think he's ready,  we both are. I start the kiss and slowly continue our stimulation. I taste his sweetness and I draw him in deep. I break the kiss for a moment to savour the life energy while he enters a state of ecstacy and surrender. I gather up the sweetness in myself and return the kiss. I stimulate him more vigourously and drip the sweetness of my life essence onto his tongue. In his ecstatic state the sweetness of the lust I'm offering back he cannot refuse. The lustful energy I took from him was made mine and as he takes it all back he drinks my essence. I draw my lips away from his and look into his eyes. He is drinking deeply, that's right you take it all in, every drop. I see his eyes cloud over a little, and slowly grow black. He's drooling the fangs grow in and his fingernails lengthen. I can see him reacting to enhanced senses and his strength and speed are awesome. He hisses back at me and has me by the neck tearing me open. I'm aroused though. Arousal makes it feel really good, seriously, must be a vampire thing. The blood is kinda soaking us already. I tear him off by the hair, he growls, and it's my turn. I take his neck and plunge him to the floor. He moans in pleasure. He is, well we are, soaked in each others blood and venom. As long as we have shared each others life energy though, we remain safe from hurting each other and the venom remains ineffective, other than being a natural body fluid and that's always something best shared. Heh. My wound has closed and is already healing over. His will soon too. I pull off him drenched in blood and gasp. I look down on him with his blood dripping down my chin. I'm purring looking into his eyes in absolute adoration. Yeah, I'm really taken by him, I can be freely sexual mind body and spirit with this man and that means a lot. I pull him into penetration again and I gasp, he is purring. My venom is pouring out we're covered. I roll and pull him on top of me and he throws me hard into the wall and roars and I roar right back. He leaps on me and throws me hard to the ground. I pull hard on his hair while his teeth are gnashing and smash his face to the floor. I pull him back and enter a deep kiss. We swap energy some more in the kiss. He tears my back open wirh his nails and I throw my head back screaming in pleasure. His venom starts to pour as he feels the release of blood from me and I'm licking the venom off his chest as it falls. I throw him to the floor in the process and ride him hard. It's his turn to scream in ecstacy now. He slams me to the ground and goes hard at me as his nails tear into my midsection, then he stimulates me while he licks slowly while his venom drips slowly into the wound. His venom is keeping the wound from sealing and that slow drinking is driving me wild, and the incredible texture of his venom on my skin. Get that, my human lovers venom on my skin. I pull up from him panting in delight and take him into my arms kissing so deeply and lovingly I think he must be melting. It seemed like forever, pure heaven in his arms. I whisper to him, ``slowly lover, gently enjoy.'' And pull him to my neck. He plunged in and licked me up slowly. I pulled him slowly to the floor with me and rested, holding his hand while he slowly licked the bleeding. This is like a brief cooldown humans have holding each other with slow stimulation. Sharing is caring especially in this ultimate intimate act. God does that ever feel good. He lifts himself from my wound and we lay there in our blood holding our hands together looking into each others eyes quietly hissing. How much more romantic can you get? We bare our fangs to each other and he has such a beautiful set. He rolls back onto me and rides me slow, takes my hand in his and bites. As he's slowly drinking I feel like I'm going to gush right there. I take his hand and do the same and now we are making love and drinking each other in deep. Slowly and deeply we continue until we can't contain ourselves anymore and he rides hard to a finish. We go to the shower and clean ourselves up after and I pass him one of my bathrobes. Doesn't fit right but it works. The effects of his drinking my life energy wear off quickly as I make some grilled cheese in the kitchen.

``Jesus Christ Susan it looks like we brutally murdered a blood bank in here!''

``I tripped on that massage oil, made quite the mess.''

``Susan the first time I thought I was dreaming. This was the fifth round and I remember clear as day what we did.''

``Oops, welcome to the wonderful world of paraphilia?''

``Susan, I had fun, I enjoyed our time together. It's only after the fact I kind of shudder and I don't think this is paraphilia.''

``Well I'm sorry anyway.''

``Susan I don't generally believe in spooks and monsters but you're a vampire. Plain and simple.''

``No no I'm no vampire.''

``Susan just because I've never seen a camel doesn't mean they don't exist. If I seen a camel I would know it was a camel and tonight I met a vampire.''

``Well, ok. I get it. They tried to turn me once. I refused submit to the transformation. Until one day I got angry. But before I was fully transformed it went aury. Now I'm a human with, umm, benefits?''

``So you don't feed on people is that what you're saying.''

``Exactly. I could, realistically. But ew. No. I'm a little beyond that.''

``Beyond it?''

``Well yeah, I'm not half turned anymore I'm finally free, you know where I'm going?''

``Yeah I do. Everybody has their issues and my last three exgirlfriends were far worse off than you.''

``The nice guys always end up with the worst girls. Sad but true. I believe you.''

``How are you ever going to get this cleaned up? For that matter this is way too much blood and fluid to come from two people isn't it? How could we suffer this much blood loss and not be in shock or something?''

``Steve, as for those last three questions, I have no fucking clue. If you find out tell me I want to know.''

``Susan, I really did have fun and if it's OK I would like to see you again. I'm heading out tomorrow but I'll be back in two weeks. Here's my number please call.''

``I don't know that country code Steve where is that?''

``It's low earth orbit. I'm going to africa with doctors without borders. no cell service out there. It's a satellite phone.''

``Oh, that sounds incredible!''

``I hope so, this is my first tour of duty with them.''

Wow, he is a really cool guy. Sounds like I might have made a boyfriend too even after all of this (I look at the floor. The walls. The ceiling.) How in gods green earth am I gonna clean up all this thick, drippy, goey, ichy blood and fluid? Oh god I'm just shutting myself in the bedroom tonight. I'll take the day off tomorrow and figure it out. My god i haven't felt this good, ever. period. Sorry harry I have loved you dearly but this is apples and oranges. I'm absolutely glowing and completely at peace. I just can't stop smiling. It was a natural and mutually beneficial release for me and I feel united in body, mind and soul. I catch a drop of blood on my tongue as it fell from the ceiling, and lick my lips. Yummy. Bedtime. Next time Susan, now that I know how I party, let's pick a better place than my living room.\\

I slept. For the first time since chichen itza, I actually slept.\\

The next day I got up and had some breakfast trying not to drool. It smells great in here. I was about to start the cleanup when a realization hit me like a locomotive. I don't bleed. I'm a vampire I don't have blood. I'm not supposed to bleed human blood for sure I have a red court heritage. I go back to the kitchen and bite my lip and slice myself up like a slasher flick. long or short, wide or narrow, shallow or deep my wounds healed shut right away. I held a deeper wound open and it was like meat with a greased up innertube backing no living tissue. That's what I expected. That's normal as I know it. Well Steve is off for a couple weeks and I'm going to a conference tomorrow for a week in Vegas. ``New Innovations in the field of Journalism.'' I'm kind of looking forward to it actually. OK, so I gather a ton of samples and samples of my DNA from when I was infected and human. I grab something of Steve too. I remember I guy from when I was in Chicago who works in forensics analysis. I E-Mail him and he said he should be able to isolate fluids and DNA within about a week, probably less. So then I finish a little more cleaning mostly involving throwing out anything that isn't nailed down. I got back and did some proofing and copy editing at work to burn some time while I stripped the walls, plastered and re pasted fresh wallpaper. I hand painted the ceiling nice and thick, sanded the floors, and other such minor cleaning tasks. It looked really nice and fresh when I was done. I got word back in E-Mail the materials I forwarded have male DNA matching Steve both blood and fluid samples including sexual fluids like semen. I expected that. What I did not expect was the samples of the female matched the sample given and approximate age differs where the DNA sample given was from a woman in her 30's but sample of blood and fluid is consistent with an early 20 year old female and the fluids are consistent with healthy sexual fluids including vaginal. My DNA from when I was human was a perfect match to what I let loose last night and one other little tidbit. The fluid showed me to be in my fertile cycle. I haven't had any goddamned cycle since I completed the change, I don't know what the hell this is.

I let out a yell right where I stood ``Eury! Holy shit I need you!'' the most I can say is it wasn't like he bothered with a portal he was not there then in a moment he was just there, pop.

``Jesus, that was fast.''

``You called. You don't normally call often.''

``Eury I'm having female problems.''

He chokes.

``Heh. I don't know much in that area. I'll get Unsere she's a nice lady.''

``How long?''

``Hard to say, hopefully not long. I can always offer you moral support. Go get 'em tiger!''

``Oh for fuck sake. I understand though Eury women shit ain't your bag, just no experience with owning such equipment.''

``Yes, that would be it.''

``Steve's coming home tomorrow so I just hope he calls like he said.''

``I do too, you need a man.''

``Christ Eury that didn't come out gentle, but I know where you're going and yeah you're right''

Then again I'm horrified that I may end up being some glittery twilight vampire. ew.
I smile at the fact that we are going to need protection though. god, i remember the forest gump movie. the part where he said life is like a box of xhocolates, you never know what you're g9nna get. for me since my saxrifice i've gone through a whole skid of choxolates and it looks like another one is on the wqy.

Steve called! holy sheep shit! I invite him over to my apartment. He seems in good spirits.

``Sorry I didn't call while I was gone. We were in a warzone and the casualties were high. I don't think i slept until i was on the plane home. I called as soon as I hit the ground though I was thinking of you.''

``I was too, I thought this might be a good time to tell my whole story.''\\

So I tell her my entire life story. Or at least anything of value. He doesn't react too much.\\

``Steve, I kinda expected more reaction. Are you ok with everything.''

``Yeah. Everyone has a history Susan, I'm glad I know now but to us right here right now it is of no comsequence except to help bring us closer. I think that's the story of a wonderful and decent person, I mean you fought in a war to save and defend people that aren't your own.''

``You're right, I'm very proud of that. Umm Steve there is one other thing you should know that I found out while I was gone.''

``Sounds like your telling your test was positive.''

``Oh God don't joke. I don't have blood steve.''

``You need more iron in your diet.''

``Oh my god stop. what a buffoon. no i mean i have a red court vampire heritage.''

``The bastards you were fighting. I remember.''

``A red court vampire never had blood. zero. zilch. leather and slime.''

``Ew. So what was that a couple weeks ago? I tasted you, we bled together?''

``I sent our joy juices off for testing. nothing wrong with you. i came back with my original human preinfected dna apparently from when i was a 20 year old woman. vaginal and other sexual juices were present and i came back as being in my fertile cycle.''

``You poked a thumb and sent it off?''

``No i had to use what we left that night to send off. i still have no blood, no matter how i slice and dice myself it just heals over without blood. the event was absolutely singular in it's nature.''

``So basically your telling me that the two of us...''

``If it is what it seems, it's possible we might, remotely conceivable we could, have a family together.''

I don't think I've ever seen a man glow like that. It's like someone just gave him his whole life of hopes and dreams on a platter.

``Steve, are you ok? We don't know ok don't buy too much into it. We just met too, like I'm gonna keep you I think you're the cat's meow but don't set yourself up for something only to be disappointed.''

``Susan, I've wanted my whole life just to settle down with a nice girl. The sew your wild oats thing just isn't me. I hate dating and I have no idea how to go about finding a casual encounter. I work all the time and i have a high income,  i just don't want to be alone anymore. Getting out more won't help i don't know what i'm doing out there. The women i have known were psychopaths and in a few cases i can only say i'm glad to have made it out alive. I've finally met a normal girl and i'm just completely swept away by you. I really dont give a damn about the vampire thing we've had a hell of a lot of fun together and my commitment was pending since high school waiting for the right girl for me so if you choose to take me off this God awful meat market i'll go with you without hesitation if you truly are the girl I see before me.''

``Steve you should be in high demand, you're a choice grade A male. Your gorgeous as hell, loving and supportive. You have an incredible personality, and are hard working and pretend i didn't say high earning. What the fuck man what's going wrong? I was sure I was only going to get that one time to play before you met your queen of everything. everything about you screams winner. You're better than next years bachelor on the same named television reality show.''

``Susan I don't know. maybe it's the INTJ personality type, but I'm sticking harder to you than a cop to Dunkin Donuts. I think you're going to make me happy and if you do, i'll make a home with you.''

``Wow, take the foot off the gas pedal romeo lets get out together some more. if work doesn't interfere we could fo everyday, if you want we could stay at each others place often or not. just don't launch us too hard sweetie we might crash. We have my place here, your place whereever that is, and my other home in red hook.''

``Is your other place large?''

``Huge, Gargantuan, I share it with other people and I have exclusive use for part of it.''

``Could we maybe have somewhere to play there that's safe? I can't imagine how much work it must have been to get that much blood cleaned out of this apartment.''

``hmm, you're right. Why didn't I think of that. Let me make a call.''
I contacted the sargeant for my scourge in red hook.

``When can we go Steve?''

``Well right now I guess. I just got back and I don't start back at work until monday coming.''

``Sounds awesome, now here's another challenge for you. There is a scourge of black court vampires there loyal to me. You've never actually met one of them yet. I'm having the sargeant meet me on the premises and the rest are to remain hidden. They are literally walking cadavers and the smell is horrific. Do you have a good strong cigar?''

``I don't smoke, so no why?''

``You should grab a small one. a couple puffs of a strong cigar might keep you from hurling the days meals.''

``That bad?''

``You better believe it.''

Well he hurled. Right on the second floor of my living area. What smells worse my stinky child or the half digested fish on the floor. I was literally weeping. Steve rested in my bedroom while we decided with sarg what we wanted to build. We decided on steel on 4 sides. We acquired some brothel ezclean vynal furnature, cushions and mats that can practically be hosed down. Got an old pressure washer from one of the adjacent buildings so we can clean up quickly. Me and the sargeant tested things tooth fang and claw and it held well. The sargeant asked what the structure was for in a submissive tone. I took Steve's hand and kissed it. Sarg broke his accent as he walked away, ``Har har har, aye mine queen, thar be the way vampires play. And our queen takes her fine mate to play in a room of plate steel.''

``Sarg really likes you Steve.''

``I wish I could say the same. He's one of your own?''

``No completely different species. Well, still one of my kids though if that's what you mean.''

I tell him of the vampire courts. He was fascinated by the white court, from our playtime experience. I said I'm curious about it too and left it at that. We retire to the main bedroom together to talk and watch tv. Much of the time we were falling all over ourselves talking and laughing. We ended up falling asleep together. It's Saturday and we both have the weekend. We play the next morning in a simple human way and it was very nice. He is such a very quiet, sensitive and sweet man. I just don't feel i deserve him, he should be with a ten out of ten woman settled with a picket fence and kids but I can't provide any of that. All he cares about is being with me though, and I won't ever give him up. I just can't. I yearn to move beyond the human sexuality again, i need to bleed for him again, to tear each other apart. To, well, take a walk on the wild side again in our new love cage.

``Susan I want to set up practise in town, well, I know it's crazy fast but maybe I could move in with you here?''

``The stinky vampires aren't an issue?''

``Do they have to be?''

``I guess not. I'll make sure it's well known you're my mate they will give you great respect. I've taught them to have respect for the prey anyway but every little bit helps.''

``You really love them don't you? You want vampires and humans to have a mutually beneficial relationship.''

``Yeah I do. I'm both human and vampire and as much as I work to reconcile myself I try to reconcile the vampire with the prey and the world around us. To bring us vampires a better life for ourselves and bring about a positive change in our world. I love my children and I want the best for them, to teach them our own manner of goodness and to be faithful shephards of our prey. I think it might sound like madness but I have faith in them.''

``Susan that sounds about as human as it gets, you really love them as their mother and trying to guide them and teach them to live a decent life. As a human I would have to say I am greatly in your debt for your manner of leadership. Also as a human I am humbled that my human mate, at least in spirit, is such a powerful and decent leader. Incredible.''

``Oh my God thank you Steve! You really mean it? You're thankful I'm leading them?''

``I shudder to think if someone else were to take leadership what might happen in the world.''

``Steve, as the days go by I find I'm more and more in danger of falling in love with you.''

``I'm very nearly there already Susan, there truly can't be any other woman like you.''
