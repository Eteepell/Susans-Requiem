preflight:

the blocked incursions, intelligence, should I be at the ready?
We will be as open as we can, wait for my acknowledgement before divulging.
Aye.
I'll let our warlocks send me, safer to have them teleport me to the complex helipad than I try to do it without a team. Last time I tried an astral realm imploded, which turned out to be a good thing, but it might not be good next time.
one of the nearby warlocks said, ``thank you for that my queen.''
Team, advise them, no wizard sight. It's not for my sake, it might hurt them.

arrival at conference with white wizards
castle in the mountains
cue everybody wants to rule the world - lorde
emerges high from black and purple icy cleft on high, wings out flies a flip and lands hard on platform facing down on one knee, castle and mountain shakes. folds wings back to herself.  warden guard raise staves. great fear. she slowly looks up and into the eyes of the wardens. After a few minutes they raise their staves from her and she rises slowly to her feet. she makes a very subtle thai greeting then speaks in klingon, ``lojmlt ylpoSmoH''(open the door!) in a quite viscious tone. All wardens return to pointing staves firmly at her in fear except for one who begins to smile widely. He walks toward the commanding warden and the commander looks back at him head cocked. then, ``what in the name of christ you want to live hold this gate!'' the guard spoke saying the information he has is critically important. when he reached the commander he whispered in his ear. The commanders face dropped and he turned to him and said ``what!?'' the warden nodded gleefully. The commander asked something of the warden and the warden translated, ``nuqjatlh?'' (Huh?) she still speaks agressively but with a smile and says, ``bangwI' qaleghneS'' (beloved, I am honored to see you). the warden whispers with the commander again and the commander says, ``stand down!'' and the other wardens raise their staves to walking stance and stand back one step. she takes a deep breath and sighs, then says, ``nuqDaq ‘oH tach’e’'' (Where's the bar?). the commander said, ```why do you not speak english? I thought you to be of american roots?'' she said, ``you have now seen me through the context of this klingon language, and the thought of the klingon will be linked with thoughts of us. many of you will remember this day and this first meeting. if not only from the language I spoke. Nonetheless now you may think of the fictional Klingon race when you think of us and our empire. We are hunters and warriors, we are not human but by God we do have honor and in time you will come to see that. By our works may you judge us. If you think of our people like to Klingons you will have come far in understanding us above other creatures and courts you have known.  glory and honor and power to the empire.'' The warden said, ``wo’ batlhvaD'' (For the honor of the Empire!) with joyful agressiveness. she smiles.
brought you to our mountain complex until we can build trust. There is rich history here, it was build by the US Air force in the Canadian rocky mountain range. It's one of I'm sure many that exist from the cold war period. The government sold it for a handshake and then it was purchased by a local inn which was able to increase it's storage for the winter months and drive down prices. Staying here has brought income and our presence safety for the little village. We can't afford to entertain you at the Hidden Halls of Edinburgh, you understand we have been far too weakened and our species have, well, great enmity for each other. The sound of battle still rings in the ear of both our species.
she said an effective arrangement. Realize that the vampire courts have lost their strongest court in this war as much as you have lost many members and wardens. Considering the council is essentially mortal to see the destruction of hundreds of thousands of powerful immortal beings speaks volumes. Even the gods of the court fell to your sword. Nay I would say only a fool fights in a burning house.
she heard a thunderous giggle from behind her that stopped as soon as it started.

************************************************************************
conference:

confronting aversion of black magic, breaking of curse, helplessness without practice of such ie. neuromancy. Opening eyes to black court attempts. Offering guidance and teaching in these arts, and the shattering of the realm of madness and what it means. 

council leans on the psychological and ethical arguements against, unmoved.

black court on her team advise on incursions already committed. A complex thrall is revealed via reporting in council secrets in front of council members, shooting the merlin with a gun loaded with blanks. Enthrallment is released then for council to take them into recovery.

The council remains silent with the revelation, then continues.

Explain the prophesies, we have heard of the events at chichen itza from those there as well as research on the ground we conducted ourselves and our collegueas in the british crown. We already have knowledge so do not attempt to mislead us.

from where did you and your empire come



she explains the edge of the knife she walks, in her life or the event of her death creation likely implodes. She prefers to remain quiet and safe. if she is safe all is safe.

so if the incident in the helicopter went bad? Instant armageddon, just add milk and stir. the outsiders wish this but it isn't easy otherwise the would have just dropped a deathstone grenade in the right place, or the right lap.

So why have you lasted this long? I have too many options. They may think they have eliminated me but not and never again find me. How? Are you familiar with the least of the power of black magic? Consider my words until now and surely you can see that even if it be reactionary I would likely ride the wave of my own power to safety---
someone in the council mutters the name ``corpsetaker''
``That up there was an abberation in the literary sense, the planning of the outsiders is far more devious than that foolishness. You are correct, those you knew of as the heirs of Kemmler would be a good reference at a far diminished magnitude.

An elder in the back recited in the stillness that followed:
Revelation 6:15
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;

it is not well for gods to walk the earth dear wizards. many have tried to ascend but few if any ever have. Yet the one who would least want to take such power to herself has had it thrust upon her, and the darkest of power at that.

What are your intents

To live my life. I want my career as a journalist back. I want the remnants of the war healed, the central and south americas who are under the incursion now of other supernatural forces some of which may in fact prove worse to them than the reds were. I am still fellowship and the injured and threatened down there are our interest. I want to know how my Maggie is doing and help her although I would dare not ever drag her into my life. 

I see.

Outside of those things I would prefer to just hide in my palace rather than enter into the many intrigues and dangers inherent in being a queen. I have a multitude of servants that continually plant and subvert these schemes and intrigues to protect our own interests. You all have been my allies, I have the unwavering opinion that although you are by no means conquests you are one of my interests. You are sheltered beneath my wings.

Enslaved. controlled. enthralled.

She looked at them in disbelief. I do want to work with you, and do what I can to allow you to rebuild on your own on your own terms. We have already foiled some attempts against you that you likely weren't aware of. We will continue to do so regardless of your position on the matter. Nothing is as dire as it seems now at the end of such a terrible war as we've fought.

again reaffirming no approach to allegiance due to past. Agreed to neutrality pact. council carries a fatalistic attitude they have no power to contend with any aggression anyway being so depleted from the war with the red court.

will you consider the unseelie accords?
No. It's my design to stay completely out of such politics and remain completely
neutral. Let what good I do stand alone.


council speaks:
stay out of our ways, and our way
we can take care of our own, do not incur on our business
you speak of honor? how do we know you have no duplicity? it
wasnt long ago red court vampires spoke to us most effectively.
We will be watching you continually. Be assured if you take any action
we will hear of it. You speak of good works? Do good works. Not for
an audience we will so your hidden action as sure as what all would see.
we are not going to be decieved again by any court, we are not food but
rather sentient beings of our own right

here now let me ask?
We will need to meet, even develop a relationship, where and how?
Is there anything we can do to help you heal?


time with children

stays with grampa a few mins, says he would say nothing to Harry even if he was
alive, he doesn't believe Susan is Susan anymore since she isn't human. So far though he thinks no evil of her. If he felt safe to do so he would destroy her to free her from this blasphemous existence. They part with a hug.

************************************************************************

Although the complex had a small eating area the inn that hosts them is well appointed in no small part of the many wizards who pass through the complex day by day. I went into human form. me and my team and the more senior members of the council. The horses were equipped with equine snowshoes and our carriage had runners rather than wheels. It worked well enough the path was well worn and zig zagged along the mountaintop down to the valley.

The locals had settled into the kitchen area for meals and brew tonight to allow the council the use of the entire bar. It is very quiet in this mountainous area, and the fire roars it's warm touch. The council members here seem almost jovial, or at the least much more settled than I've known them since the war years.

``your people are, comfortable here.''
``we are away from everything here, miles away and miles high from anything that might seek to harm us. This village and the complex are both filled with enchantment, you and your people are here because we let you in.''
``that doesn't exactly explain everything, I'm still what I am.''
``a few of them. Well. They seen you with the children.''
``They, what? Sorry, I can explain---''
``there's no need. As much as you carry yourself with us they seen more warmth from you there than is possible with any vampire. More warmth than you had when those here who worked with you during the war had seen. More warmth in fact than anyone has ever seen in you either before or after. It's a curious thing.''
I felt like my face went red, it happens, I'm in human form. He loosened up himself in seeing it. There are certain physical aspects in combination with a person's actions that show better who they are than their own words or acclamations of others could ever do.
``You said it yourself Susan, when you arrived you said By our works may you judge us.''
One of the young wardens asked me to dance and I giggled like a schoolgirl, then slapped my hand on the table in frustration of my inability to maintain my demeanor. The were a few knowing faces turned to me. I've known many of these people for a very long time and that night was like a school reunion. We can return to our cool demeanors tomorrow.
