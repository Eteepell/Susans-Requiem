\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{W}e rose the next morning having fallen asleep on each other in a lump. We were exhausted just from the emotional toll of Unsere's visit. There was so much I didn't know and the truth was a mixed bag of hope and terror. There is a lot me and Steve will need to talk about once everything settles in properly. Steve's mom woke us up but didn't say much, either thinking I'm repentant living on God's mercy or considered that it looked like the two of us were hit with a strong dose of ether and just dropped hard where we were. Which was about as close to the truth as it gets.

Steve's dad is taking me out to the neighbours today, and Steve is going to try and shim up the longwire antenna for the shortwave radio. Televangelism will never die on the shortwave dial. After breakfast me and Steve's dad checked out the field. There are some footprints I do see. Human footprints, not heavy at all though they must be from a very frail person. They are coming from the wooded area, and seem to be migrating in a straight line.

``Peter whats out there?''

``It would be that huge farm where the migrant workers are.''

``Hmm. You said there were some gone missing?''

``Half a dozen maybe, just up and vanished.''

``How many reside out there?''

``It's a tent city, about 10 men there altogether.''

``How long has it been since the men went missing?''

``About a month. Everyone is assuming they took off to get illegal papers, not thinking anything 9f it really.''

``Ok well these prints go to and from that direction. When did the last man go missing?''

``Three weeks.''

``Whats happened in three weeks, and rain, wind, anything that would remove these prints.''

``We had a downpour a week back, these prints should in no way be here now if it was one of those men Susan assuming he really did take off.''

``What kind of footwear do they have?''

``Construction boots, the family that owns the farm just wears sneakers.''

``They don't do the same kind of work?''

``Well leave the heavy stuff for the paid help I guess, it's what their paid for.''

``Reasonable enough I guess, they get a decent wage?''

He raises an eyebrow at me.

``Right, migrant workers in a tent. Needing more coffee.''

``I'll put some on when we get back.''

``OK so these tracks are consistent with work boots so may be a migrant worker. the workers may not be forthcoming if their own are helping them forge papers to get out. This would be the logical solution. Nonetheless until I see with my own eyes I won't presume. What is there in that tree lot?''

``Well it's about a mile or two in circumference but more of a rectangle. Just young growth in there, from maybe the past hundred years or so. It used to be a farm before the owner vanished.''

``Fascinating, just like these migrant workers?''

``In a sense yes, but there hadn't been any such disappearances in those hundred years.''

``Tell me about that farm, anything left of it?''

``Well the buildings still stand in there. Theres a small woodframe house standing attached to a horse shed. the barn is gone but the silo is there. There's an old mine that's been boarded up since before the farm even stood.''

``A mine? Good place to hide, and a house even better.''

``Not that house, it stands but with little of the roof left and most of the second floor collapsed.''

``Walls intact?''

``Well, yeah, it's ok otherwise.''

``Could provide shelter from wind and downpours, put up a tarp inside and it would be cozy enough.''

``anywhere in the wood should prove sufficient.''

``Not if all you have is a colorful tarp, you would stick out like a sore thumb. inside an abandoned house noone would see you unless they were on top of you.''

``Actually I didn't think of that.''

``It's a nice bright day, I say we check out the woods before we knock on doors.''

``We're going home for some coffee and breakfast first, we're going to need some nourishment. You like canadian bacon?''

``Do I ever! Anything that can be described as `bacon' is going to ring my bell.''

We get back and I devour breakfast. I'm so thankful I can eat real food, given my body. Athough I knew the reds could eat food that doesn't say they took enjoyment of it. I do. mmmm bacon!

``You have quite an appetite Susan, how on earth do you keep that figure?''

``Worry and fret, Peter, I take everything on my shoulders.''

``Don't worry so much Susan, leave it in God's hands it works itself out fine in the end.''

``Not always, it is so easy to say but darn hard to live the ideal.''

``It always is Susan, all we can do is try. It really does work itself out in the end. Maybe not in the way we expect or want but it does always turn out.''

``Amen to that Peter,
