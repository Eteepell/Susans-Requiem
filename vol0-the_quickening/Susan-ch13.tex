I awake. I'm feeling very groggy. I hear a voice say, ``Ah. Good, you're awake. How are you feeling? ''

``Like roadkill. Where am I?'', I said.

``Mount Sinai hospital, I'm Dr. Steve and I've been assigned to your care.'', he said.

I looked around, a hospital bed lay next to me with the privacy curtain partially drawn. I can hear staff being paged in the hall and a nurse request button is clipped next to me. I looked and I'm wearing a hospital gown.

I said, ``OK. What happened? ''

He said, ``From how I understand it an Englishman called an emergency on an inbound flight and emergency services brought you in here in a stupor. We were told you were witness to a firefight and shortly after were advised of the death of someone close so it makes complete sense for you to need to be here. I prepared something to take the edge off the nurse will bring it in shortly. As it is I don’t see why you shouldn’t be out of here in a short time we just need to get through this crisis.’’

I said, ``Easy for you to say. You didn’t end up in an asylum all broken in the head.’’

He said, ``It’s not an asylum at all, you are still in the hospital as an inpatient. You can leave tomorrow if you wish but it would be against my recommendation. Let us do our work, you won’t do anybody any good if you leave just to crack again. Consider this a place to rest a while, a time out, or going on strike. You’ve been through a lot, most anybody would be here as a result.’’

Whether it was a week or two I can’t remember, the doctor was right it was too much and I popped my lid. The second night I grabbed a book from the book cart that rolled through the wing every night. I weaved some baskets and coloured some adult colouring book then the afternoon I read in the fireplace room. There was some excitement a couple times including one patient who needed over 20 security guards to subdue. She of course went to the bubble room for the night after some injections. The funny thing was she was a tiny little young woman who looked incredibly innocent. I guess you never know.

When I got out I borrowed a copy of the book and finished the read in central park. Dammit it had been so long since I actually sat down and read a book, that was therapeutic all in itself. After returning the book I returned to a red court human form from the fully human form so I have the benefit of seeing what’s coming and fighting or fleeing depending on circumstance. I grew up in New York and most people live and work without getting killed it’s not that bad but I have other vampires and perhaps other supernatural beings that could be keen on ending me.

I slipped into a small 24 hour cafe and had some coffee and a snack. I need to get in contact with the fellowship here to figure out what needs to be done next. I think the first thing would be to get myself into some type of media like a newspaper or set myself up somehow with the public that I can use my skills and get influence with the right people, or just simply with people period. I need to work with the fellowship though to make this work, the contingent in New York would know what is best to aim for since they’ve lived here a long time and have been here during the years I haven’t up to and including the present.

As I sat pondering I smelled something quite foul. Like a cadaver. A black court vampire is here. Other customers slowly started filtering out the door and the waitress flipped to sign on the door to closed while she tried to locate the source of the stink. An individual in a cloak and cowl slowly moved over to my table and sat across from me. Glancing outside I seen that the sun had set. It was definitely the right decision to change form.

He said, ``Greetings my queen, pray you do not take offence that I had failed to bow, I thought it prudent not to alarm the humans here any more than necessary.’’

I said, ``Umm, sure, no problem. Are you a friend of the one known as Damian?’’ He might not remember me but I remember him, what a piece of shit.

He said, ``Certainly not, the foul creature. He has been working against your word in promoting the old ways. I am of the empire, one of your servants.’’ He made a slight bow of his head then said, ``I have come to take you to your seat of power below this city of humans.’’

A dangerous proposition indeed, but what do I care now? What do I have left to go back to? Ah fuck it. Maggie has a good family now she doesn't need me. All I could do is screw up her life now, she deserves a normal life with a normal family. Oh I wish I could just lay down and sleep my life away; to not think about anything anymore; to not feel anything anymore; to just be numb for a while; to take a break from this torment. What is the point of existence if existence is pain? If only to escape from it and hide away somewhere the pain cannot find me.

Maybe this throne is a real world answer, maybe I can hide myself in this place that few If any know exists. Maybe here I can escape the pain.

Into the street I followed him, and down into the subway. We travelled until we reached an abandoned station. The lights went out then amid the confusion my companion pulled me out through the slifhtly opened door. The train continued and the lights came back on. This station is oddly ornate, and in all my youth living in New York I cant remember this station at all. Everything is dusty but there are tapestries of rich material. The columns are gold and silver as is the floor. As far as I can tell it is no veneer. The cathedral like ceiling is gold with a profuse adorment of precious jewels. i dont imagine even the most powerful human could never imagine to have ownership of anything so rich and beautiful.

``I never caught your name'', I said.

``I am known as seth my queen.'' He said.

``Why have I never remembered this place when I was young?'', I said.

``Our kind has always kept this place a very close secret. We have sufficient psychic capacity that the sentries here are able to cause humans and some others to simply dismiss this place as inconsequential and forget about it. Mind you unless being used that curtain hides it well.'', he said.

Just as he said there is a curtain that looks like a dirty and old line maintenance tarp. That would indeed work well there is always work being done on New Yorks underground tunnels.

``So what now?'', I asked.

``Now we wait for the royal train.'' He said.

``Yeah, ok. Im real tired can I rest? I have a hard time giving a fuck after recent events. Nothing personal.'' I said.

``Of course my queen. I have been informed. We will be waiting only a few minutes you may rest once you are aboard.'' He said.

``So how long will I be on this train?'', I asked.

``The travel will likely take 8 hours if there are no unexpected delays.'' He said

``8 Jesus we going to Buffalo?'' I said.

``Nay, we are not going across country it is way down we go.'' He said.

``8 hours down sounds like we're going straight to hell.'' He said.

``I must say some have insinuated no less, I dare say not. It is my home no matter how dangerous and it is the seat of your power, your throne. Forgive if I speak poorly my queen but I think you will heal more quickly resting in your own house.'', he said.

just as he said the train arrived in a few minutes. I could never have imagined anything so ornate as this train. It in no way resembled a subway train or any other for that matter. The outside was all stone intricately carved down to the most minute detail. Microscopic detail it would seem. Different stones merged together as if they were one and even the thinest rock structure has held as strong as if it were rolled steel. The outside had the appearance of having rolled through a blast furnace which was a rathet forboding sight to me.

Seth seen me looking at him and said, ``yes my queen it would be wise to remain In your true form especially one we arrive. Any other may serve you a quick death upon disembarking.''

I folded my wings behind me and the dissappeared into my form. His words fell on attentive ears. The inside of the train was no less beautiful than any other. Fine leather and precious metal. Extremely minute and intricate carving throughout. The train had about a dozen segments for sleeping and eating. It also had a meeting area, bar, and my personal room to rest and sleep. It had a tv. I missed tv. it was not ornate in here, a shower, bed, tv as I mentioned, and a stocked beer fridge. I grabbed a couple cold ones, threw on a sleeping shirt and relaxed. The kitchen brought in some pizza, corn chips and popcorn when I threw on some movies when the game was done. How they knew im not sure they brough things in right on cue as if they already knew me. If this is a sign Seth was right. This is pretty damned healing after all the shit I went through. I fell asleep during some action flick and had no dreams at all. Just as I would want. Any dream that would come to me now would be no less than a nightmare. How could it be anything but a nightmare when my waking hours are a nightmare?

It was like no time had passed. I blinked and 9 hours had passed. Seth knocked on my door to notify me 30 minutes until arrival. I've drooled all over myself. First thing I do is jump in the shower and get dressed. I leave the room and head to the lounge car. The first thing I see outside the window is that there is a natural light, a fire like glow, and sparks flowing gently and occasionally bursting out along the train. 

Then I see the tunnel suddenly open into a cavern that has an expanse far beyond the line of sight. Even for my sight. Rock and lava flows, and volcanic activity. Lightning streaks down and hits the tops of tall buildings which are made of solid stone. Solid stone skyscrapers en mass reach far into the height of the cavern.

I say, ``What is this?’’

He says, ``This is the seat of your power my queen, a city beneath New York that is no less the size of New York itself. In this city is your palace and your throne. I realize this is the first you know of this, and that it is hard to take in. We that are your people have sworn to keep it safe since long before any person can remember or any record can speak.’’

I take the pills I received from the hospital and hold them away from me. I drop them to the ground while holding my other had out and swear by all that is holy and true I will not partake in any more of the goddamned poison that would make me have such visions as this.

I say, ``Seth.’’

He said, ``Yes my queen.”

I say, ``I must drink.’’

He said, ``right away my queen.’’

He shortly comes out with a small minibar on wheels. He offers me what drinks there is available. I see a half gallon jug of 40 creek whiskey in the bottom tray and grab it. I try to pour a drink but my hands are shaking too much so I forsake the glass and take both hands to steady the bottle and kick some back like a barbarian. I put my back against the wall of the train and slide down until I’m sitting on the floor. Then take another swig of the whiskey.

Seth said, ``We are still a little less than an hour to reach your palace. We travel at great speed from the mouth of the tunnel across these plains of fire.’’

I said, ``Where are we really?’’

He said, ``To be somewhat more precise we are far below the New York underground and far deeper than the dangerous undercity of supernatural creatures. We sit where the mantle meets the core perhaps 10 miles down. We are as far down as could be imaginable. A place of fire; a place of burning brimstone; here is where lava flows and volcanic eruptions are constant; here as well is where lightning strikes like a heart beating with life; as the fires burn below, clouds of smoke cover the ceiling above and the ash endlessly propelled aloft falls like snow back to the fiery ground below. It is a beautiful place. The unique and rare gems and metals that are surrounding us are mundane here, yet these would be precious metals and gems of the surface world.’’

I said, ``Looks like the goddamned Hadrian era out there.’’

Gulp whiskey.

I laid my back against the wall, and slowly slid down with my eyes wide. I hit the floor and, gulped more whiskey.

Reflecting for a moment on what I saw I said, ``What are the pangolins out there? That cuteness is the one redeeming factor to that godforsaken landscape.’’

He said, ``Those pangolins as you say are our current development of an environmental suit to allow any creature access to the grounds in order to perform tasks. Those who use them have enhanced strength from the powered nature of the suits. They’re self-contained and self-powered.’’

I said, ``Oh. Well pangolins are cute anyway. I’ll just call them pangolins.’’

He said, ``As you wish my queen.’’

We then arrived at the door, so to speak. As it was explained to me the tracks don’t end but rather continue back out in a loop. So we paused at the end of the loop in an antichamber. Seth told me that all access to the environment takes place through an anti-chamber so the heat doesn’t flood the inner chambers. The mystical power imbued in this place allows for dramatic changes in the ambient environment indoors vs. the conditions outside as long as there remains a physical barrier between the two. This particular one is the size needed to liberally contain the train. Torches are lit upon exit and the ground I see is loose gravel of volcanic rock, and there is also a beautiful clean and flawless red carpet leading the way to a large wooden door. A sign above the door reads, ``Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.’’ in latin. I glance over at Seth.

He said, ``Yes I know, sounds like Dante. How was he to know the phrase was already taken? We didn’t exactly have a copyright office during the first half of eternity.’’

There is a crew of around half a dozen who all disembarked from the train. 3 lifted and dropped the door knocker 3 times. I noticed there is absolutely no echo in here, as if I was floating in space or something. I anchored my feet, grabbed the bottle with both hands and glugged the whiskey some more. Damned primevil shit. The door opened, two doors actually I only thought it was one. An overwhelming stench of decay hit me, the air was cold and damp. I heard water every once in a while but no more. There was a slight breeze but I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. There were support columns ahead on either side of the carpet leading forward. I could see two torches very far ahead with a very large stone throne. The columns were the size of the typical low rise apartment building in circumference which goes to help me comprehend the immense dimensions of this place. I think that throne is a mile away. Literally. If I didn’t have my true form eyes I would never have seen it. That’s all my senses are telling meso far.

As we entered the chamber another vampire, a white one this time, took his place behind and to my right. Seth took his place behind and to my left. Seth said, ``I am the top ranking in your followers my queen. I am called the Master-at-arms. At your other side is Rodney, he is the one called “Counsel’’ in your ranks. We will explain more later. If my queen would be pleased I wish to bring you forthwith to your own chambers to compose yourself. Your’s has been a hard journey thusfar and I speak not of the meager train trip.’’

I nodded in agreement and we started forward. I was able to refrain from the firewater and yet by the time we got to the other side it looked like Saving Private Ryan and my companions were holding me up to the point of dragging me.
