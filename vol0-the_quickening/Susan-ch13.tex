I awake. I'm feeling very groggy. I hear a voice say, ``Ah. Good, you're awake. How are you feeling? ''

``Like roadkill. Where am I?'', I said.

``Mount Sinai hospital, I'm Dr. Steve and I've been assigned to your care.'', he said.

I looked around, a hospital bed lay next to me with the privacy curtain partially drawn. I can hear staff being paged in the hall and a nurse request button is clipped next to me. I looked and I'm wearing a hospital gown.

I said, ``OK. What happened? ''

He said, ``From how I understand it an Englishman called an emergency on an inbound flight and emergency services brought you in here in a stupor. We were told you were witness to a firefight and shortly after were advised of the death of someone close so it makes complete sense for you to need to be here. I prepared something to take the edge off the nurse will bring it in shortly. As it is I don’t see why you shouldn’t be out of here in a short time we just need to get through this crisis.’’

I said, ``Easy for you to say. You didn’t end up in an asylum all broken in the head.’’

He said, ``It’s not an asylum at all, you are still in the hospital as an inpatient. You can leave tomorrow if you wish but it would be against my recommendation. Let us do our work, you won’t do anybody any good if you leave just to crack again. Consider this a place to rest a while, a time out, or going on strike. You’ve been through a lot, most anybody would be here as a result.’’

Whether it was a week or two I can’t remember, the doctor was right it was too much and I popped my lid. The second night I grabbed a book from the book cart that rolled through the wing every night. I weaved some baskets and coloured some adult colouring book then the afternoon I read in the fireplace room. There was some excitement a couple times including one patient who needed over 20 security guards to subdue. She of course went to the bubble room for the night after some injections. The funny thing was she was a tiny little young woman who looked incredibly innocent. I guess you never know.

When I got out I borrowed a copy of the book and finished the read in central park. Dammit it had been so long since I actually sat down and read a book, that was therapeutic all in itself. After returning the book I returned to a red court human form from the fully human form so I have the benefit of seeing what’s coming and fighting or fleeing depending on circumstance. I grew up in New York and most people live and work without getting killed it’s not that bad but I have other vampires and perhaps other supernatural beings that could be keen on ending me.

I slipped into a small 24 hour cafe and had some coffee and a snack. I need to get in contact with the fellowship here to figure out what needs to be done next. I think the first thing would be to get myself into some type of media like a newspaper or set myself up somehow with the public that I can use my skills and get influence with the right people, or just simply with people period. I need to work with the fellowship though to make this work, the contingent in New York would know what is best to aim for since they’ve lived here a long time and have been here during the years I haven’t up to and including the present.

As I sat pondering I smelled something quite foul. Like a cadaver. A black court vampire is here. Other customers slowly started filtering out the door and the waitress flipped to sign on the door to closed while she tried to locate the source of the stink. An individual in a cloak and cowl slowly moved over to my table and sat across from me. Glancing outside I seen that the sun had set. It was definitely the right decision to change form.

He said, ``Greetings my queen, pray you do not take offence that I had failed to bow, I thought it prudent not to alarm the humans here any more than necessary.’’

I said, ``Umm, sure, no problem. Are you a friend of the one known as Damian?’’ He might not remember me but I remember him, what a piece of shit.

He said, ``Certainly not, the foul creature. He has been working against your word in promoting the old ways. I am of the empire, one of your servants.’’ He made a slight bow of his head then said, ``I have come to take you to your seat of power below this city of humans.’’

A dangerous proposition indeed, but what do I care now? What do I have left to go back to? Ah fuck it. Maggie has a good family now she doesn't need me. All I could do is screw up her life now, she deserves a normal life with a normal family. Oh I wish I could just lay down and sleep my life away; to not think about anything anymore; to not feel anything anymore; to just be numb for a while; to take a break from this torment. What is the point of existence if existence is pain? If only to escape from it and hide away somewhere the pain cannot find me.

Maybe this throne is a real world answer, maybe I can hide myself in this place that few of any know exists. Maybe here I can escape the pain.
