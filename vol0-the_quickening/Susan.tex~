\chapter*{Preface}
{First off this is not a Dresden files knock-off. Susan's story has it's own unique character. She is developing stories and relationships all her own and building her own story canon completely independent of the dresden files series, touching only lightly on it. Comparing the two is apples and oranges these two storylines differ heavily. Maybe that's a big blow for some fans of the Dresden Files but suck it up sweeties she's her own woman now. The material is also much raunchier and twisted than dresden files and freely replaces pseudo-vulgarities with the real thing introduces unapologetic erotic features(including paraphilic). Also I am a daemonolater in the real world, literally "demon worshipper" in translation but misleading I will not serve. So also a practitioner of the actual left hand path and initiate sorcerer. It's not as awesome as it sounds no ``fuego`` or anything like it. Think religion, like Wicca meets ACDC.

A final note I've never really been a big reader so the vocabulary is rather straight forward. I only started reading a lot since I became disabled a couple years ago and mostly dresden files novels.

\chapter*{Introduction}
{Losing Susan Rodriguez hurt. As a result I decided to spin-off the character beginning with Susan's survival. Susan's returns full circle back to being the annoying journalist she was. She is going to see happiness and make new friends. Expect her to struggle with her past and find healing. She is going to work to adjust to the dark new world she is entering into. She will find ways to be there for her daughter. She will also learn about herself and that which is hidden, and alien to this world. Her research and publishing of articles have some real world history and occult. In a real way she might be publishing our own true paranormal stories to us unveiling the extraordinary and magickal (note the K at the end) about our own world under the guise of the ancient and forgotten. Over time she is going to gradually learn what she has become as a result of when she was sacrificed, and how she retained her soul. She pours her self-knowledge into her passion for journalism and develops a personal code of ethics necessary for the powerful entity she has become.

\chapter*{Background of Susan}
{Not everyone is a Dresden Files fan so not everyone is going to know who Susan is or what she's been through. This series is going to be an independent endeavour from the Dresden Files proper so once her background is explained here it will be easier to get into the following story. So here goes:\\
