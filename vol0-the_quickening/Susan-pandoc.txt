Prologue {#prologue .unnumbered}
========

Not everyone is a Dresden Files fan so not everyone is going to know who
Susan is or what she’s been through. This series is going to be an
independent endeavour from the Dresden Files proper so once her
background is explained here it will be easier to get into the following
story. She was very much a main character in the first three books, then
disappeared until death masks skipping a book. There were six books
before she had a major role in changes only to die at the end by Harry’s
own hand. Her hopes ended.\
So here goes:\
Susan and Harry met when she arranged an interview on the opening of his
business as a professional wizard in Chicago. It was a couple years
before the Storm Front novel. She was a reporter for the Midwest Arcane
at the time which was a supernatural version of today’s tabloid with
stories like “JFK’s Mutant Ghost Abducts Shapeshifting Girl Scout.”
Little did people know from time to time the stories were real! Susan
even went into syndication.

She had a tendancy to hound Harry for a good story although she had an
ulterior romantic motive, and made no attempt to hide it. Of course her
romantic expression served her well in getting information as well.

She is attractive, intelligent, funny and appealing. Her motivations are
clear and simple, and she is honest in pursuing them. She is absolutely
relentless. She has used her sexuality in pursuit of information. She is
very aggressive and was the one to ask Harry to dinner not him. Susan
took Harry out for their first date and treated him. She has a smile all
her own, a patent smirk with her lips quirking up at the corners. Her
hair is midnight black. She has dark eyes and a deeply tan complexion.

The first three books were completely Susan. She could easily have been
the other primary protagonist as far as I was concerned.

In Storm Front she asked Harry out for dinner. Well, kinda tricked him
into dinner in a playful way. She wants what and who she wants and works
hard to get it. She and Harry ran into a demon they needed to combat. A
toad creature. They did it but barely, Harry called down lightning on it
and Susan was vomiting most of the time from potions Harry had her
drink. The date turned out to be the worst night of Susan’s life. As
well as the best story she had written so far.

In Fool Moon, the second book in the series, her appearances gained
speed until about half way through the book she took the drivers seat.
Literally. Getting Harry out of the mess he got himself in as well as
being the driver for him and those he needed her to drive for. Including
some young werewolves. Susan saved the day in this novel and Harry was
along for the ride.

In Grave Peril Harry was about to marry Susan though it wasn’t apparent
until near the end. They are still dating heavily and very serious. She
had her first sight of vampires in this book, but not her last. Harry
got an invitation to a ball by a local vampire that just got promoted to
the nobility. Susan forged an invitation to get in with Harry. Harry had
protection under the accords but she didn’t because she was never really
invited. This particular vampire held him accountable for the deaths of
two people she loved. Vampires being what they are in the Dresden series
she swore to dedicate her life to exacting vengeance against Harry in
one way or another. She found a perfect way. She knew about him and
Susan so she stole Susan away and “turned” her. Basically this ended
their relationship because Susan was walking a tight rope from that
point on, she hungered but if she ever fed she would complete her change
and become something else. No more Susan. For now, denying her hunger,
she could survive and live as a human but arousal, exhaustion, or the
smell of blood, or a number of other things might cause her to lose it
and make a kill then game over.

That was the last we seen Susan, she did not have a part in the next
novel but in the following one she did reappear briefly. She had been
fighting the vampires in South America and doing humanitarian aid to the
residents there. South America was the heart of the Red Court Vampire
territory, the world pretty much ignores what happens there and it had
gotten really bad down there. They followed a high ranking vampire back
to Chicago (where the novels take place). She gathered her belongings
from the city to take back home and intervened against the plans of the
vampires while there. Harry and Susan got to fight again and went to a
ball together. They even had a dance together. Then she left to rejoin
the fight in Central and South America.

It was seven novels of wondering what happened to Susan and when she was
going to find the cure for her vampirism. In that final novel “Changes”
she fights with Harry to save the daughter they had together (that he
didn’t even know existed). In the end of the novel Susan makes that
first kill and begins to change. Their daughter was saved from being
killed in a sacrifice and Susan was killed in her place.

That is where the Dresden files story ends and the Susan’s Requiem story
begins. Her life will never be the same.

Susan Rising
============

> “Martin,” I said, my voice low and very quiet. “Did you tell them
> about Maggie?” He closed his eyes, but his voice was steady. “Yes.”

t that moment I was beyond saving. I’ve been on the edge ever since my
daughter Maggie went missing, and now here we are at the altar of
surrounded by vampires and their many minions determined to sacrifice my
baby girl on the altar. I need to save her. My emotions are on high,
I’ve been far too close to losing it and now dumbass Martin tells me he
led my only daughter to the slaughter. I couldn’t see through my rage, I
was so far beyond control I don’t even think an immortal could have
stopped me. My vampiric part foreseen it’s victory over my will and
poured it’s power into me and drove me quickly and irreversibly to my
kill. It shackled me to it’s purpose and terror came from my soul to
intermix with the rage. My humanity foreseen it’s own death but was
unable to pull back, the vampire in me had stolen control to ensure it
takes the life it needs to fully emerge. Quick as lighting and lithe as
a snake, I took Martin down hard and made the kill with complete
abandon.

I knew what was going to happen to me but Martin was calling the shots,
using the one thing that would be successful in causing me to lose it.
To really really lose it. I just didn’t care. I desperately wanted to
care. I could do nothing but devour his life blood. I tore out his
throat the feeding was so vicious. When he was dead I was changing. It
was too late, I couldn’t take it back. I had control of myself but only
for a few moments. Oh my God the pain, horrible intimate euphoric pain.
Searing with power and pleasure as I experience the wretched agony of my
flesh tearing from the inside out. I started to feel the pain give way
to a new mass, a new body not my own was devouring me and emerging in my
place. The monster has been set loose in me, in my loss of control I
sacrificed a life to the slumbering vampire and brought it forth to
consume me. I think my hands came first as they were elongated and
clawed, breaking through my skin. I seen the new being crawling beneath
my skin like a snake or worm, a ghastly sight to behold.

She is coming, the vampire that I am to be, she is not me. I could feel
the others coming, other vampires. I heard the memory of the Red Kings
call to battle. I hear them, I feel them. My vampire half is becoming
whole in me, while I live it now coexists with me but I will not be here
long. My soul is soon to be consumed. Harry reminds me I am the youngest
of the red court now, I can destroy them all by my sacrifice. I can take
every last one of the red court. I scream to Harry to save our daughter
Maggie. Maggie was all I could think about, I have to save Maggie.

Harry took Maggie from the altar as gently as he could, and laid me
down. I am still being consumed, I haven’t much longer for my humanity
to live. Harry promised me Maggie will be safe, I felt confident in his
words. That didn’t completely absolve my worry, and it did nothing to
absolve the sheer terror I felt over what is happening to me. Harry was
going to sacrifice me. I’ve never been so scared in my life but I still
knew it would preserve me from the completion of my transition, and
destroy the monsters that have caused so much suffering. Oh I was so
scared. He closed my eyes with his hand, and kissed me. It was a sharing
of our blood and our tears. I cried out to Maggie, perhaps just to tell
her everything will be ok, but I don’t think it came out as more than a
whisper.\
*Then Harry cut my throat, and I was dying.*\
All was black, but for less than a moment. Lighting came down from the
heavens and struck me in the darkness, maybe it was a dream, but it kept
frying me for what seems like forever. I felt the consumption of my
body, well, come to completion. Bye bye human me. After a time I felt
myself floating up and seen myself, my blood flowing out from all over
the altar. My body glowing and sparking with energy repeatedly, like
when lightning hits a large transformer in the street. The energy slowly
being absorbed. The vampires were gone, my friends survived. I am dead.
The whole red court is gone including myself the youngest of their kind.
Thank God for that. Soon enough I know that sweet chariot is going to
swing low and come to carry me home.

Harry was in such pain. I could see it. I rested my hand on his shoulder
and tried to talk to him. He neither felt it nor heard it but I could do
no less. Harry is standing there, in shock, not moving. The vampires all
fell leaving nothing but black sludge. The infected were mostly killed
except the younger ones, since the vampire part was killed and it was
what was keeping many young, even alive.

Walking toward the altar is the Erlking and I take my place beside
Harry.\
“Huntress, Sir knight, well met.”

I had to check but yes, I’m still a ghost. I turn to Harry with a tear.
Yes ghosts have tears, apparently.

“To you as well.” I said.

“I hope thou wilt be pleased with the strength of thine new nature
huntress. Nay, I played no small part in bringing it to you. I was most
certainly pleased that thou wert the first to have been my guest. Thou
art honorable and wise my dear, such cannot be hidden in you. Thou
likely thinkest that thine visit to mine realm twas coincidence? Be not
a fool I willed it so. I was needful that you could be near me, that I
might know that thou wert pureborne.”

The Erlking smashed Maggies shackles and placed her in Harry’s hands.
“Thou art the greatest hunter of thine kind, I cleared thine path for
you. I ensured that thou wert slain. Your life has been hideous child,
thou wert pitted against thyself like thou wert thine own prey, to live
thou wouldst needfully refrain from the kill and blaspheme thine own
nature. It is now abolished in you. May you and yours now hunt in
freedom and rejoice in the kill. Thou hast redeemed thine species in the
shedding of thine own blood. Thou art now free to join your hunt without
fear of destruction. Thou canst replace these dishonourable wretches
with thine own children as thee see fit. A pity I could not get the
chance to hunt the red king and his ilk myself.”

I don’t see where I can enjoy the hunt as a spook, or how me and Harry
can make little spooks together. Bloody Markov chains I’m gonna have to
wait out the answer.

“Perhaps you might elaborate more and explain what you mean?”, I said
while arching an eyebrow.

“Thou art always welcome as mine guest o’ queen, then shall we speak
together by the fire enjoying our kill.” The Erlking bows low to me. He
looks at Harry with a sort of piteous eye, “I promise that by my hand
thine mate shall not be slain. I know thine mate twas torn from thee in
a most hideous way.”\
Then at that he swiftly left on his way. Harry seemed to come to his
senses after what seemed like forever. I couldn’t help but smirk. It was
just as well he would have been confused as fuck. I sure I am. As a
matter of fact a helicopter came in and landed taking in a couple
people, then left. Harry still stood there with a thousand mile stare,
holding Maggie. I stayed with him, I wouldn’t leave him, even if he
couldn’t see me. I hear our friends conversations with my enhanced
hearing. I sat there with Ebenezer and Harry while they chatted, they
were none the wiser. It’s amazing he is actually Harry’s grandpa, I
wonder what other wizards are in Harry’s line. I wonder if my Maggie
will be a wizard when she grows up? I’m not sure how to feel about that.
I still sat there with Harry as Karrin came over to chat. Harry was
determined he was going to give up Maggie for adoption. Oh my God I was
scared, but then I realized what I did but giving her up to a familiar
family was pretty close. I hope he decides against it but if he does let
her go for a better life I would understand. The rest escaped into a
portal and Harry’s Faerie Godmother remained. I felt my purpose
accomplished and as I heard the sound of a vehicle approaching I begun
to feel light and being pulled somewhere. Well this is it then, I’m
going home to the family I’ve never known. I get to see the hereafter
and Godwilling enter into paradise. I was being pulled toward the altar.
My body was melting into the same black sludge as all the reds had,
mingling with my blood and seemingly seeping into the stone of the
altar. As it did I was drawn into it rather than being released like I
expected. I was terrified that my soul was meant to be trapped in
forever.\
Fuck.\
Then I was sucked into the alter.\
I guess that chariot isn’t swinging low for me after all.\
As I lay there some words I heard earlier that day keep repeating in my
mind.

> “You son of a bitch,” I said, “You fucking traitor.”
>
> Martin’s expression flickered at my words. But his eyes never left the
> Red King.“I give you the Fellowship of St. Giles, my lord,” he said.
> “And I beg you to grant me my reward.”
>
> “Reward,” I said, blind with rage,“What could they possibly give you,
> Martin, to make it worth what you’ve done…”
>
> “And what do you get?” I said to Martin. The Red King states,
> “Ascension.”

I hear him say ascension over and over again in my head. What is
happening?

I’m dead. The silence of this altar allowed reality to catch up with me.
My life has been wasted. Ever since I was half turned life has been
nothing but a struggle and getting killed has been my only release from
it. I knew it would be that way though, deep in my heart I knew the only
escape was death. The fellowship had been working on a cure for a
vampires turning ever since the fellowship came to be hundreds of years
ago. They never found it. Either I must die, or make a kill and allow
the vampire part to consume me and take over. I think Harry is going to
be ruined, the man is going to need full time therapy when he gets back.
Sure he’s tough but this is too much. On top of that if Maggie were
aware of anything going on she will be scarred for life. I want to just
hide in this altar indefinately, just hide away from the reality of what
happened outside of here in that world outside. Hide from the hereafter
and from what other transitioned souls might say in my afterlife. What
am I really? Innocent or guilty of making a kill? Depends on who you ask
I guess. I place no blame on Harry I climbed right up on the altar and
waited on him. The question is am I culpable of something?

What an odd word to use when Martin would perhaps be promoted within the
court, raised to an office of a position, ascension is like to a king
ascending to a throne of Christ ascending to heaven or a lesser being
ascending to Godhood. Would the Red King really want Martin, being of a
traitorous nature, to take power to himself in a worldly way much less a
supernatural way? Really, who is Martin to raise him up to any position
when any given responsibility would be poorly invested in anyone who
could have executed such a grievious betrayal as he had done. The red
king is mad but I don’t see how he could be that mad. So if it was
intentional it may be something the king was going to inflict him with,
ascended and enslaved. Given significant power. Or something Martin was
to cause, his actions are to cause and ascension of something or someone
else. Everything is speculation right now.

That first evening, 30 minutes after sunset, came some rather
interesting events. Some creatures in hidden in robes came into the
temple. I say creatures as I felt the power radiate from them. It was
not like anything I have ever felt. Like monks their hands were joined
hidden under their loose sleeves and their faces completely hidden in
their cowl. Dozens came into the temple and prostrated for a good ten
minutes face down at the altar. Five came to remain in the temple. Three
remained prostrated while two came through the entrance bearing a gold
ark. They rested the ark in front of the other three. They then
prostrated behind and took sentry at the entrance. The three then rose
and two took the ark by the handles at either side. The remaining
creature between them removed a crook and flail from the ark and rose it
high.

I seen his arms for the first time and they were completely mummified.
The markings indicated it might be a creature called an arch-lich, which
until now I thought was only legend. They were told to be ascended
creatures with the full power of godhood but earth-bound. They refused
to ascend into the realms of never never as a god with a typical rite of
ascendance. They instead chose undeath in order to refuse the
responsibilities and visibility of godhood in exchange for the freedom
and anonymity to pursue personal power, especially arcane power, to the
exclusion of all else.

The two to the side raised the ark and moved it forward to the alter I
was in. The passed it over the alter and placed it with great reverence
to the rear of the alter. The creature in the middle processed behind
them and placed the crook and flail gently on the altar, stepped
backwards a few paces and prostrated again, then the two came back from
the ark and did the same beside him. Then the two at the side levitated
up and remained facing the altar five feet apart. The central one came
to levitate behind the altar. All had heads bowed low in the cowl and
hands joined inside the sleeves of the ritual robe.

I see on them a coat of arms. It is emblazoned on the entire front and
back of the torso on their robes. I don’t understand it but maybe in
time I might. A dark woman in a dress appeared to bear the coat of arms
on her shoulders while crouched, with a sword outstretched to either
side. Her mouth was open and fangs prominent. She is the coat of arms
compartment. Behind the shield an imposing mountain is portrayed in the
background. To the right a panther is represented with one arm holding a
flail ready to strike, then on the left is a pheonix bearing a crook on
which it appears to lean. The crest is a terrible but majestic crown
sitting on a golden open faced helm. On the top of the crest is
portrayed a dark and terrible representation of a Seraphim, or perhaps
demon-phim if there is such a thing, with it’s wings outstretched over
the whole of the coat of arms. The wreath is a dark but glorious crown.
The shield was with ordinary in chief. The lowest field was blood red
and the upper was Tyrian purple. The lower contained a messenger pigeon
with a scroll in it’s beak and the upper was divided with the left
containing a triad of oak trees and the right had a prominent cross
flory. There was writing but it was not latin or any language I’m aware
of yet. I observed what appeared as a motto at the bottom. From what I
see the order is “[[ SDR FL OL LT ]{}]{}.” The motto is in three parts.
The engravings flow in a ribbon below the woman and the order in a
draped ribbon. It reads, “ [[ BIAH OL CHTZVT OE MTIF SIAION, OL
LECHAPPES OE MTIF TM TT - KRK’M, OL LCHSHVF L GV OIAD HRM OL DRILPI LT
]{}]{}” At the very top appears what seems to be a motto on a ribbon
which is draped from the neck of the Seraphim. It appears to be flowing
like in a light breeze. It reads, ”[[ OL LEHAF’IL OIAD HFLH VVTR OL
NANAEEL, OL LHCHRZ MTIF L-BALTOH NORA CICLES ]{}]{}” Finally etched into
the hilt of the swords I seen when the crook and the staff were laid on
the altar was the phrase [[ SHAKAR ON CA SVZN RVDRGZ ]{}]{}

Something big is going on I feel it. I need to understand it and what
role I’m playing in this game. who is the mastermind and what are his
intentions? I’m in danger even as a ghost. Since I got sucked into this
altar it’s pretty clear to me something is weird and why would the
Erlking have said that weirdness that he did? I’m all questions and no
answers, very fews clues either. I need clues. I need answers.

The night passed and the creatures remained in reverent contemplation of
the alter. 30 minutes before sunrise they took their leave. They
performed their ritual in reverse order taking the crook and flail out
in the ark in the same manner it entered. I heard the sound of people
outside but none of them entered the main temple area. I was able to
overhear conversations. and the surrounding area, for many miles out,
have been quarantined with the official purpose of maintenance and
repair. In actuality various organizations that are clued in to the
paranormal are present performing research into what happened. The white
council of wizards of here. Scholars of the british monarchy are also
here as they became clued in during the wars with the red court. The fae
are here and as I understand it Mab herself, the queen of winter, spoke
clearly that any who entered upon the temple over the next 5 days and so
much as overturned a single pebble will know suffering unheard of since
the beginning of time and will not end even to the time the oceans will
boil dry. The threat was leveled against any and all who are present
even all fae outside her own court. I feel quite confident of my doom
knowing that as I remain in this Godforsaken altar I risk the cold wrath
of Mab should she ever find out.

As I understand it there is complete devastation in a 10 mile radius
from . Trees and vegetation are non-existent and a ring of intensity
exists in the distance where the heat of the power coming from the earth
melted the earth itself into glass. I noted they said it came from the
earth, not inflicted upon it.

None of those who were present in the day stayed any later than an hour
before sunset. There wasn’t a single fool that stayed in the darkness of
a place that had seen the greatest display of evil power the world had
ever known.

30 minutes after sunset the devils monks, or so I’m calling them,
returned and performed the same ritual as the other night exactly in
every detail. Within the hour came visitors. The stench could be smelt
long before they actually arrived. Black court vampires. They looked
like walking corpses and smelt no better. The robed monks of hell or
whatever they were raised their heads. At the sight the vampires stepped
back slowly and the skeletal creature in front began to shake as the
monks looked down at him from a levitating position. They turned their
head back slowly to the escorting vampires and slowly nodded. They
backed away from the entrance to allow them to enter. I have never in my
life seen a black court vampire shake with fear like that.

Dear God what in hell are these robed creatures? Could I be right that
they are arch-lich? Even Lich are not known to have ever really existed,
having been told of in arcane legend but never seen.

The terrified vampires entered into the temple in absolute silence and
the skeletal creature stepped forward. The two monks that hovered
diagonally to the alter floated forward. They held open hands to the
skeletal creature and with shrieks and screams of pain the skeletal
creature burst into flame, floated up and burst into nothing but dust
which scattered throughout the temple. The monks then folded their hands
back into their sleeves and dipped their heads down as they floated back
to their designated positions. Everything these monks did were slow and
perfectly calculated.

The remaining vampires hit the floor in prostration faster than a sack
of potatoes, faces flat to the floor. The shaking creatures remained
there for some time then slowly and reverently left. There were others
of the black court entering that night, other sacrifices. I believe the
sacrifices may have been the elders, oldest of any given group, and the
first one having the semblance of a skeleton might have been the
foremost elder of the court. This seems like more than just a solemn
remembrance of the fallen red court. I’ve never seen sacrifices made in
the name of remembering a fallen evil. I think these monks are cooking
up some kind of power move, forcing obedience of the vampire courts
somehow. I still don’t know for sure what they are, a true lich of
legend would be completely unconcerned for the matters of the world
being absorbed in their arcane studies.

The same ritual occurred again before sunrise, and the researchers of
various groups came and spoke of their findings. Or lack thereof. No
soul dare enter into the temple again today.

That night humans came to the entrance. The monks on sentry stopped them
with a gesture. They slowly turned their heads to the human group and
slowly bowed their heads again facing them. The humans burst into true
form white court vampires. Having witnessed the monks countenance they
fell to the ground and took some time to pull themselves back together.
The monks floated back to allow entry and didn’t move the breadth of a
hair more. The vampires entered into the temple still shaking and the
two monks made the sacrifice like before and the remaining vampires fell
in terrified reverence. There were other processions of white court
vampires just as there were processions of black court the other night
continuing to just before dawn and the monks withdrew in the perfect
recreation of their ritual.

The third night brought a very large procession of creatures. I
recognized a few of them as being phage. Anotherwards vampiric creatures
outside the vampire courts who exist in realms outside of the physical
world, mostly different parts of the nevernever if not all from there.
They were not good, but certainly composed of both the bad and ugly,
sometimes both. There was no pause in the procession and the sacrifices
were endless.

The fourth night brought battle. One of the sentry monks exited It
sounded like a battlefield outside the temple. After a short time he
returned with a warlock walking in front. It didn’t look like he was
moving of his own volition. The monk returned to his designated position
and the warlock was sacrificed like the other creatures. Remaining
warlocks, warlocks, and other mortal users of black magic entered and
prostrated. In the latter half of the night came all manner of undead
and a great host of sacrifices. I seen skeletons, zombies, and others of
all manner of breed and class known and not yet known.

At the end of the night the monk who stood behind the altar moved
forward and another stood at the entrance. The two monks who floated
diagonally to the alter moved forward and sacrificed him. The monk at
the entrance moved into the temple and all the monks prostrated until
the prescribed time in which they ritually exited the temple.

The fifth day a feverish investigation took place to find out what the
sounds of battle were the night before but no one found anything of
note. Still unwilling to enter the area after sunset it was decided that
being one day away from the deadline Mab had set they will investigate
the temple on the sixth day and remain overnight to determine what is
happening in this area. I think that might be a very good idea except
for the fact that it looks like they would get squashed like flies.

That night was very interesting indeed. The greatest powers of the
created universe came to present themselves in solemn meditation. Some
stopped in the middle of the temple and held their hands out open palmed
like they bore gifts. The monks went to them and held their hands above
palms down and either nodded yes or no. Those who received a yes came
forward and placed their hands on the alter. I then felt something. It
was different every time one of the gods or powers did so. That night I
seen entities I did not know but also those of the known pantheons
including the norse, caananite, sumerian, native american, and more. I
seen the arrival of both Odin and Loki. One man followed shortly after
Odin and Loki who came with a cow. The cow was clearly intelligent and
bore a gift. The monks approved and the cow licked the alter which
bestowed the gift. With all the intensity of the last few days I needed
the giggle that ensued.

I don’t know for sure what to make of what happened but it feels like I
was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I think the altar represented
the genocide of the red court and the past few days were payment for
allowing the red courts destruction. I’m thinking the monks are somehow
intimately connected to the former red court. I wondered why they
weren’t at the final battle but there are any number of reasons why. If
they are lich they would not concern themselves with such worldly
matters. If so though why such incredible reverence from them? I guess
we know very little of them though, only a scattering of legends that
until now weren’t known to refer to a verifiable entity but rather a
non-existent figment of legend. Time will surely bring better
understanding of these events.

It was in the middle of the night when the monks performed their exit
ritual this night which put me on alert. Something is happening tonight.
I realize this is the fifth night, one that Mab defined as being
significant somehow.

Shortly after they left I feel my body rise, the next thing I know I’m
lying on my back on top of the altar. My arms are crossed fists on my
shoulders, causing me to reflect on the fact that there was a crook and
flail repeatedly placed on this altar over the past 5 days. If they were
still on this altar they would be perfectly in my hands right now.

![image](Images/hrule.png)

I looked at myself and shuddered.\
Oh God, I’m not human. This was the true form of the red court vampire.
I really did complete my change. I felt normal though. I seemed to be
physically a typical red court vampire except for maybe the odd thing,
like talons rather than claws that resemble razor sharp scythes. I felt
hungry. I felt very hungry. Oh my God sweet Jesus mercy and pass me an
artery hungry. I had control for now. I caught the scent of human on the
breeze and crouched low in a tiger’s purr. The sound caught me by
surprise as the red court never made such cat sounds that I’m aware of.
I was a little different somehow. I concentrated a little while and
managed to put on a flesh mask, a convincing one, but being naked I
decide to forego the flesh mask and go with the xenomorph look. A
xenomorph born of a man sized vampire-bat host is the essence of what a
red court vampire true form looks like. H. R. Giger never goes out of
style.

All around, throughout the distant countryside, it sounded like popcorn.
Anarchy had descended in the land and armed conflict is everywhere.
People and paranormals were struggling in the power vacuum and damage
caused by the destruction of the red court. No good deed goes
unpunished. So here’s what I needed to do then, find the nearest town
and investigate more of what happened. I would look around here but I’m
hungry. I’ve held my hunger as an infected I should be fine now, but not
for long. Maybe I could take a couple sips while I’m there, I’m not that
bad off right? A little nibble, that’s all.

I leapt to the edge of the temple, onto the stairs of the pyramid. I’m
smelling the air, I can’t help it, my vision goes from black of midnight
to the shadows of twilight as my eyes see through the darkness. I smell
life-blood and I see the glow of human life off in one direction, at
line of sight. With a growl I’m off. A growl, like a great cat. Not a
shriek, wail or hiss as would be expected of my kind. Heh, my kind.
Shoot me now. I laid tracks fast for the source of the radiance and I
see someone driving a truck down the road and I hit the windshield at a
speed faster than the truck was moving and smashed the bloody carcass
out through the back window onto the road. I utterly destroyed the man
tearing flesh from limb with my claws, chewing, sucking, lapping and
gulping every last bit of the poor victim. They wouldn’t even be able to
identify him with dental records. I was too hungry to have any control.
I genuinely hoped someone would just shoot me.

A black court vampire appeared. He seems to be quite unusual, like from
the Sherlock Holmes era, except for the chainmail gambeson draped over
him and the combat boots he wears a very upper class Edwardian suit. God
he looks cold as ice even for a vampire. He throws down a child he just
consumed, a little 4 year old boy, blonde hair and freckles. dead and
gone. He pops his collapsible top hat, and bows to me with a flourish of
his hat. Then fills a pipe and speaks.

“Has anyone ever told you of natural selection? Foolish morsel decided
upon himself to go forth into the night and deep forest I know not why.
Most certainly I can say of him that he quite simply is a feeble-minded
child. It is well that I had found him that he might be most
effectatiously culled from the local herd. Alas it nearly came to pass
that the noble vampire society might have been deprived of this most
delicious morsel should he have perished in and of himself. Do you not
agree dear lady? Yet as you are a most grievous poacher, oh what shall I
do?”

“You fucking monster!”

“Ah yes, this I have heard many a time. ’Tis rare though that I should
hear it from a kindred species, ’twould seem like to the pot calling the
kettle black as they say. Let it be agreed then that I am a monster. So
what of you dear? I cannot accuse you of wasting a single drop of that
kill all chopped up and wrung dry so don’t you dare be hypocritical. At
least my kill is in one piece. I’m proud of who and what I am. Are you?
I don’t think you are.” At that he withdraws something from his
gambeson, damn. He’s got a jar. Like as in “A Jar” trademark pending, a
weapon I’m sure was first devised by the fellowship against the red
court. Although not really used for anything but vampires, they may work
on other supernatural entities or powers. They have no effect on humans.
On vampires we used them as grenades and mines, hard as hell to get them
triggered but when they do it’s a guaranteed capture and the vampire is
trapped in the jar which acts as a spirit container. We would then bury
it deep, if we could drop it down with a post-hole digger we would. That
way, just as Damian said, the creature would sit and rot until the
second coming.

Problem is, now the shoe is on the other foot. I have no idea how he
could be so confident that he won’t get trapped but being I’m of the
vulnerable species now I’m in hot water. He must be either crazy or
stupid. My money is on crazy.

He casually taps the pipe empty on his gambeson and replaces it in his
pocket, then drops his walking stick aside. He holds up his right hand
and with a few words a slow moving black and purple ball slowly forms in
his palm, the size of a basketball. I understood the words though I
shouldn’t have. I’ve never known such a language.

He said, “Livyatan niis d ol nobloh tzrvt ollor adin zerimah”

Instinctively I know it means, “Leviathan come, into my hand forms a
gentle flow.” Although I have no idea of the implications of the words.
I repeat the words in english out of curiosity and see black and purple
mist, unfocused energy flowing around me.

He said, “Most singular indeed you are. It was best that I should have a
jar in hand.”

Without much warning he said, “Lhtchl” and the ball hurtles at me, I
throw myself and roll. The ball curves toward me, I vault behind a tree
and the ball crashes into the tree. The tree makes a low moan like it
was being subjected to an immense weight then is still. Even the leaves
flutter far too slowly given the force of the wind today.

Then he said, “Flereus niis lishloach mad setani prg lehashlich, pon
oyev” and a ball of flame hurtled from his hand directly at me. Fire is
not good, I’m particularily vulnerable to it.

It burnt straight through that same tree and the tree fell to the earth.
Of course the ball of flame caught me off guard and I hurled myself just
in time, it grazed my left bicep burning it off straight to the bone and
I wailed, the shoulder on my other side hit a rock hard on the ground
where I fell and I wailed again. I leapt backwards and came up to stand
with two useless arms.

He leaps to tackle me and I dodge, he lands where I was just a split
second ago.

No he predicted it. His walking stick is special I see, he wielded it as
a sword stick and sliced open my belly. I figured I was done for but the
wound stuck and I managed to bear through the pain and land a hard kick
on him. I break his neck, which heals itself before he falls to the
ground. I really hate vampires. Myself included.

He grabs for the jar but I’m already on the road ready to speed away. he
throws the swordcane hard and in crunches into my hip. I sorely miss my
firearms. I had an automatic pistol once I really loved. Snap out of it
Susan, don’t drop now, fight.

I’m on the ground. I can’t move. He is throwing the jar for the final
attack. I’m at the rear quarter of the truck. My arms are working again.
I throw a rebar off the truck which goes right through his side but it
only redirects the jar slightly from my head to the steel quarter panel
where it triggers.

It was right where it needed to be. Right in the sweet spot. Inky black
smoke licked out of the jar and just as I was afraid of it enveloped me.
It felt like being on the scariest rollercoaster ever. I shrieked. After
that, I was a jar. Good job Susan, I hope you like being a jar. It is
surprisingly spacious for a vampire in a jar. I never knew that. Rather
than infinitely small it’s infinitely spacious. Must have something to
do with the magic used. A rebar sails into the truck and it starts to
roll backward crushing the jar. I’m released with a pop to land on the
road with a plop. I return an insolent smirk at him. My body feels like
jello and I yank myself to my feet by grabbing the truck and hurling
myself to the other side.

I hear a familiar word of power, damian says, “Fuego” and a laser beam
of fire pierces the body of the truck and wings me on the way to the
ground on the other side. I howl and wonder what can I possibly do to
overcome someone proficient in magic. I tear off the back quarter panel
and narrowly block a rebar yet it still shreds through and narrowly
missed my right arm on the way down. Split in two I swung the one side
of the quarter panel at him knocking him to the ground and head to the
side of the road. An unfocused ball of fire burns toward me and I turn
what’s left of the quarter panel and deflect it skyward. the impact
sears my hands as the metal turns molten and throws me into the
treeline. I break into a run deeper into the treeline and hear an animal
behind me. It closes on me as I run then it’s jaws tear at my ankles. I
fall. Damian appears ahead of me and I roll as he hits the earth with
his fist and around me the earth begins to buckle and split. It splits
deep and my hands grasp the other side of the fissure to catch myself
from falling in but it is still splitting and soon I won’t be able to
reach the other side.

Damian says, “Wonderful my lady, ’tis most suitable that you should
perish for all the trouble you seem to cause me. I do forsake the chance
of casting you into the jar you are hardly the willing maiden with such
a spectacle you have displayed.” I fall into the crevasse, grabbing into
the rock face and landing on a small outcropping on the way down.
Holding onto a couple awkward handholds my feet are hardly wide enough
to span the size of the outcropping. Soon I’ll be heading into the lava
pool at the bottom with the shaking of the ground as the ground
continues to split.

Damian says, “Well adieu then dear lady, may I suggest that you should
refrain from holding onto false hope and embrace the fires below. I
assure you your destruction will be quick then there shall be no more
pain nor suffering of this most noble vampire existance. I wish you
could have embraced your nature and come to be my comrade and not mine
enemy.”

At which point he heartlessly walks away. I expected such heartless
behaviour of course from a creature who could make a kill of an innocent
child. I have a rather perplexing situation now though, I can’t reach
the top I’m too far down. Another quake causes part of the face of the
cliff to fall and I grab new handholds just in time as the old ones give
way. I’m leaning farther and farther over though I’m going over. I pull
hard on the handholds and manage to get myself back against the rock
face. Oh God what the hell is going to get me out of this. I look around
but only see sheer rock face with handholds I cannot reach. Another
quake causes more erosion of the cliff face. I try using my talons but
it just erodes the rock face faster rather than grabbing hold. Too much
earth mixed into the rock. Another quake and the outcropping I’m
standing on falls. I’m holding desperately onto the handholds and I
scream this is freaking crazy I’m going to die right here. No matter how
much I can regenerate a lava pool is permanent. A handhold crumbles then
another quake causes the other to crumble and I’m in freefall. I slash
my talons into the rock face and manage to slow my descent but there is
no other outcropping to save me. The lava pool is getting closer then my
talons hit something substantial, solid rock, the impact jars me and my
feet don’t seem to feel the rock face anymore. It seems to be some sort
of tunnel. Oh thank you Odin. I rock my body like a pendulum and throw
myself into the tunnel. This is something that looks untouched by man,
stalactites and stalagmites, dust on the floor of the tunnel undisturbed
by any creature.

I fall on my ass, shaking with adrenaline. OK I just need to figure out
how to get back up the fissure. What’s around here. Is there at least
some vine? The ground rumbles again. I look out into the ravine and see
the walls closing back together. Oh man I gotta find something. My heart
is in my throat, I’m scrambling around in the pitch darkness with
vampiric vision to find something to get me out of here and back to the
surface. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Another rumble. I grab a
stalactite and place it between the two walls. Another rumble, the
stalactite shatters. The walls are sealed. My fate is sealed.

I can see in here with vampire vision. The tunnel is wide open. A room
essentially. No way out.

I sit down on the floor of the room. Now what. There must have been
something I could have done to stop this. Harry would have found a way.
He gets in this sort of thing all the time. This really isn’t my bag.
Clandestine strikes. In and out. Fellowship style. I can do that. I have
no right to be in a battle with an entity like Damian. I was outclassed.
I should have ran, found a way to hide. Just let him jar me maybe
someone would find me. What if he buried me though? Noone would ever
find me. What was I to do? Now I die here. Maybe this is going to be my
jar. I’ll just go crazy in bloodlust and fade away. Hidden beneath the
earth, noone will find me and I can harm noone. He was right, I should
have saved myself the pain and just thrown myself into the lava pool. I
want to die anyway. I don’t want to live as a monster. I don’t want to
be this creature. Why do I feel this way though? I’ve never known a
vampire to display such self loathing. They are narcissistic, maybe even
psychopathic. What am I? I am so terrified. I want to die but I don’t. I
want to live. Somehow. To find a cure, to refrain from the feeding
somehow. To stop killing. To stop hunting. Should I even attempt to find
a way out of this. It’s futile. Why should I?

To stop the vampires that’s why. To find a way to defend people against
the supernatural forces. I am the only one with the strength of a
vampire, the speed, the invulnerability against their hunger. They can’t
feed on me, we’re made of the same stuff. I represent a hope for
mankind. Despite being a human predator. Is that what they call an
anti-hero? I guess that’s me.

Right then, time to get the frick out of here. I need to feed and I need
to get somewhere to find out what happened to me. I have a purpose. I’m
like the only vampire with a human soul. I don’t know how but I’m
important, I don’t know how but I came to be for a reason. Some
mysterious reason. I need to learn my purpose and fulfil it. I need to
get out and back to the road.

I look along the walls of the room to see if there is a break into a
further tunnel or chamber. In the twilight sight of my vampiric eyes I
look as deep as I can but see nothing. On the floor of the chamber is
nothing. Some dust but no footprints. Every once in a while I trip on
something I should know is there. I look and see nothing. I must be
exhausted. I lay down for a few minutes. What am I missing? Please don’t
tell me I was meant to die in some cavern. I was never a big cave
explorer, although I can see how beautiful it is in these deep places.

I feel bad for messing it up. Walking all around scuffing up the floor
of the cave and leaving it disturbed somehow. Like it’s unclean in a
way, having been touched by a person it’s like it lost it’s virginity
leaving footprints all around. Hey wait a minute, I didn’t leave
footprints? Such a fine dust on the floor I should have left footprints.
Something isn’t right in this place. I swipe the floor with my hand, I
don’t feel dust. I look at where the rock face was and I see there once
was a tunnel. The spell closed it off though. OK there once was a way
out. Now there isn’t. To hell with it I’m laying down, this is making me
tired.

As I lay down I see on the ceiling what looks like a switch. A silver
switch embedded in a green jewel. I had to smirk from the irony. I get
it now. Tripping on things not here. Not leaving footprints. Some kind a
veil. It has to be. I feel around the walls and find many discrepancies,
and something in particular I was looking for. I find what looks like a
ramp along the wall. The creator of the veil would have been able to see
through it and climb to the switch to disable the veil so others could
see. I blindly climb up the ramp and sure enough it takes me to the
switch. I move it over and the veil disperses. I find myself in a ritual
chamber. Skeletons are scattered on the floor, wearing ritual cloaks.
Wizards, warlocks, something like that. Something killed them, a very
long time ago. That was what I was tripping on were these bones. I jump
down and look around. Magical ingredients many of which have long
expired. A gold ritual circle embedded in the floor. An alchemy alcove
and bookshelves along the walls. The floors and ceiling are perfectly
flat and polished to a sheen. I check along the walls to see what’s
behind books and I find one bookshelf opens to reveal a tunnel, well
hewn with carbide lamps along the length. Time to move out of here,
Travelling along the tunnel I find it slopes up. It continues on
forever. I come to the end to find a door which opens up into a
basement. Stairs lead to a cabin via a secret door in the floor, under a
rug no less. Everywhere is long unused, but still functional. The cabin
still holds some useful supplies, it seems it was enchanted against
decay even if dust and spiderwebs still accumulated. I found some nice
post-vietnam gear, olive drab combats and alice webbing. An M-16 rifle.
A 20mm vulcan sniper rifle fitted to breakdown for 2 to 3 man carry,
various loadouts mostly HEI. An M1911 semi-auto pistol. Jars and
grenades, a mix of anti-paranormal and conventional loadout. Goldmine.
Now I have a better chance against paranormals. I shrink into a skinmask
and don the equipment. I feel a little more normal now, and a lot
relieved. There were some notes in the basement though, it is a
furnished basement and the way to the cabin was through a trap door.
Somebody wanted to hide something.

I arch an eyebrow. It looks like the papers indicate wizards stayed
here. I came from their ritual room. They were hidden down here away
from a significant contingent of red court vampires in the wilderness. A
smirk slipped out as I see the unusual skeletal remains of reds. The
wizards sent some of the monsters to hell before they were killed
themselves. It must have been a fast kill as usually they dissolve. It
was a covert mission to find more about a legend within the higher
echelon of the red court. An archaeological mission in a sense. The
queen to come, the great mother. I copy down some notes of the material
for use later. I think this is what I was looking for, I may not need to
go to the town after all. As I search through I see some personal
letters of the team of wizards who were researchers here. Letters from
wives, kids, mothers, the odd incomplete letter that was going home to
sweethearts, sons and daughters.

I need air, I need to get outta here. The wizards deserved better, they
were husbands and fathers on a scientific quest, they were not of any
threat to the reds. Why were they killed? The reds were monsters, that’s
all I can say, and the world is better off now that they’re gone. I race
up the ladder and can’t open the door. I yank and beat the door I can’t
get out. I let out a shriek and the trap door glows. Now it’s locked. My
skin is burning, it tastes like cool mist but burns me. Holy water. I’m
going to be burnt up by this mist. I triggered a defensive trap that the
wizards set in the cabin in case any reds came into the door. I need out
now.

I look up and see the mist is descending from the ceiling, I grab a
table and hold it above me. It helps but the mist is still swirling up
and under the table and I don’t know how long it is going to be coming
down. I look at the notes I scribbled down but I only wrote the
information I needed, not any words of power that might be useful here.
How was I to know this was going to happen? I scan around the room,
displays of taxidermy, a fireplace, wooden floor and ceiling with mist
pouring out between the boards. I try to get into the fireplace, no go.
There’s a window, but a wall of force holds it safe. I swipe at the
ceiling and the force sparks off my talons. I’m showing the equivalent
of 3rd degree burns and not regenerating. I shriek again, this time in
pain, I’m at a loss, how can I stop this slow death?

How would the reds have gotten in? Of course, turn a wizard and they
have his knowledge and skills. An age old trick. That only means there
is a way to bypass this trap but it doesn’t tell how. Only that it isn’t
something particular to reds that triggers this, I can get past it.
Somehow. Words, if it isn’t detecting reds it must be controlled by
magical words. If I was a wizard would I have placed the words somewhere
in this cabin? Where? I don’t have much time I’m melting away.

Under the carpet, I check, nothing there. I lifted the table up there
wasn’t anything under it, no note. It would have to be accessible when
triggered somehow. Either that or it just stops sometime after I’m
melted away and there is no failsafe. No there would have to be the
wizards may have taken red court samples in here if there wasn’t a
failsafe their efforts would melt away in their hands. There has to be a
failsafe. Hey wait a minute, maybe I did write what I need down, but it
isn’t instructions it is a word sequence to deactivate this trap.

I’m reading my notes to see if I wrote something odd verbatim to check
later. The letters are english, spanish, portegese, italian, latin,
russian. When I was alive I could speak and write english and spanish.
Now I can read, write and speak them all. Am i panlingual now?

“We’re not in the cabin anymore sweetheart, we’re safe now they can’t
find us. If they do though we only need to refrain from cease the mist
and all will be fine –”

Huh? Oh. As in if they do find us, double negative? No, refrain from
then grammatical disaster. What if I’m looking for “cease the mist”? the
all will be fine is declared as a double negative so it seems to affirm
the possibility. Of course pseudo-latin. Here goes, I say, “cessare in
caligine!” And– nothing. I don’t know that cockney latin, at least not
for spell work. Maybe I resonate with enochian. I heard Harry say once
magic works not by rite but by self. If I believe something is powerful
and works for me that’s what really will work for me. This time I say,
“lehafsik oiad arafel!”. I hear a moan from above, then drops fall and I
dive under the table. My bones are showing through now, I’m cadaverous.
The dripping slows, then stops. As soon as it seems safe I dive for the
trap door, it opens, and I close it behind me. I am in so much pain. I
wrap myself up in some blankets that I find in the basement area and
rest inside a closet to try to conserve heat. After a while I drift off
to sleep. I’m not going to be leaving this little cabin. At least not
today. I remain sleeping on and off for a couple days, healing less
quickly than I normally would but I healed nonetheless. My clothes are
fine since the attack was just using water. I’m rather hungry now
though. So here we go again. This is what pisses me off, if I would
consider myself some sort of anti-hero considering whenever I put
myself, or get caught in, the fray I get hurt. When I get hurt I get
hungry. When I get hungry I hunt, and I kill. I don’t want thralls to
sip off of I could kill them if I get hungry enough whether I want to or
not. I would addict them to my venom. There has to be an answer. There
has to be a way out of this existence. I dare not call it a life. Is
this equipment I have going to help keep me from getting injured? Is
there a way I could just randomly sip, no killing, no addicting? At
least until I can take full control of feeding. Just stop feeding. Or go
vegan or something.

All that aside I need out. I should kit up and get out of this basement.
If I trigger the trap again I know how to get out. It probably just got
triggered as a combination of my presence and pounding on the front
door. So move around normally.

I go upstairs without trouble. I raise my brows and smirk as I find a
front door key under the mat. As I left the door locked behind me and
the key works fine to open the door from the outside as well. It is a
proximity key, a magical one, the mechanical lock on the outside is a
ruse. I go back inside and kick my feet up on the couch and burn my ass.
It’s still wet from the holy water. I go back into the basement.

So what now? I can get out, but then what? Where should I actually go? I
can’t stay here, I have a little information now there isn’t a need to
find a village except to feed. No matter which direction I go I’ll find
food. Eventually. Maybe I can link up with some former fellowship
people, people I’ve fought with. I can find out news about what’s going
on and decide where to go and what to do. Again it doesn’t tell me which
direction to go. Maybe going outside there might be an easier way to
figure out where best to go. The sniper rifle has extremely long range
sights. The roof, a tree, I need to find a high vantage point to see far
around and decide what to do. When I was outside I could see I am at the
top of a cliff face, I’ll take a reading off the compass I have in my
kit. OK, let’s check things out.

The road is to the west, a mile out. Not much but forest around. Cant
see south I’m partway up a mountain. There is a path down from here so i
think thats my next move. The discharge of weapons in the distant
countryside looks like twinkling stars in the night. It looks like the
black court are getting a foothold i see them moving amongst the trees
in many places. I see slavers are active, many bodies hanging in trees.
A nearby river is filled with bloated corpses. Its Armageddon out here
sweet mercy.

I see near to the road black court are approaching a fellowship
fire-team about two and a half to three miles from me. It doesn’t look
good for the fire-team. Looking around me I see I can sight in better to
the south east of the cabin. I gotta get off the roof, recoil could
damage it. I leap down to the ground and setup the sniper rifle.

I understand this is normally not a man portable weapon at nearly two
hundred pounds and two yards in length. Luckily the weight is negligible
to me and it was modified to be broken down into smaller pieces for
transport.

I setup the rifle normally on the ground supported by bipod stands. I
load contact trigger HEI rounds, then load and lock the bolt action. I
got the targets located again. Nothing too hard down there so I bide
time until the central vampire walks abreast a rather hard looking
boulder. I squeeze the trigger and a massive explosion erupts from the
muzzle. A muzzle flash five or six feet in diameter of smoke and flame.
I have only a moment to see some faces turn thinking im a panzer that
just fired a shell. Then the round hit, the target vampire was
vapourized shrapnel and incendiary sprayed back off the rock as the
impact shattered it. Two more vampires were incapacitated. Not knowing a
high powered sniper rifle from a small artillery piece the remaining
vampires ran one way and the fireteam ran the other. I made a fistpump,
Yesss! I really like this piece! I raised a smirk, put a hand on my hip
and flipped the bird in the direction of the vampires with the other.
Nobody messes with Susan. I took a moment to dedicate my rifle by an old
fellowship sniper creed. A variant is used in the usa military but which
motto came first I may never know.

I hold the rifle high in both hands, facing it, as I kneel on both
knees.

> This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
>
> My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must
> master my life.
>
> Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I
> must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is
> trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me, and I will.
>
> My rifle and I have love knowing that what counts in war is not the
> rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know
> that it is the hits that count, and we will fire true.
>
> My rifle is loved, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will

>
> I will keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We

>
> Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders
> of good. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my
> life.
>
> So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.

I lower my rifle to my lap and lower my head in solemn contemplation. My
weapon is now dedicated. I grab the assault rifle in my hands and start
my descent.

I missed the chance to contact that fellowship fire-team, but there will
be others. I’ll need to get down from this place to find more fellowship
fire-teams and find my way out.

I feel like I’m descending into hell. Gunfire is erupting all around me
and I just seen the horror of what’s happening with my own eyes. The m16
assault rifle is leaning over my shoulder. The gravel of the trail is
crunching under my feet and I hear the sounds of nature scatter and
gather avoiding stray bullets from fire-fights below. I take out miswak
and chew to try to give myself something other than impending doom to
think about. No use hitting the dirt to avoid any fire I don’t think it
would help. It would only postpone my inevitable destruction. Yet the
road ahead looks quite inviting and safe. If only it were true.

Conveniently the road exited close to the road. I considered whether I
should stick to the road or track south through wilderness. I decided
just to take the road, as long as the number of enemy encounters isn’t
ludicrous i can make better time and there is nothing safe out here.
Getting out fast is the only way.

If I can get stories published in America about what is going on down
here in south america, anything at all, then I can get interest focused
down here and get aid coming this way. Otherwise I’m just a sitting
duck. Get the facts, fly north. Those stories should get me work, work
gets me the money to get back to Harry and Maggie. Easy right? Heh, best
laid plans.

The road was quiet for quite a while which I was glad for. I’ll be able
to make good time to the airport.

I hear the most terrifying roar coming from the east, I check with
binoculars and see a soldier in a canvas cloak tent facing some
civilians. About a dozen it looks like. He throws off the cloak and he’s
revealed to be a mansized insect, a mantis. I can assume a nevernever
creature. Likely fae, likely demon. A mile and a half away I wont get
there in time. The creature rears up and extends its raptorial arms to
grasp its meal. I slap together the sniper rifle but by the time i do it
has skewed two of the hapless people. It didn’t have a chance to finish
the meal though my rifle was up and I did something only a supernatural
creature could do, fire that massive weapon off my shoulder like it was
a target rifle. The recoil caused my rear leg to plow a row into the
road. A massive muzzle flare and the creatures thorax exploded in a mess
of ectoplasm. The remaining people ran and the creature seemed dead. Yet
started regenerating. Oh God. Whether its me or those poor people that
creature is going to chase us down. I strap my rifle to my back and
sprint straight for it. I open up a clip of the assault rifle on it when
i get close enough but it only slowed the regeneration down slightly. It
rolls toward me and roars like a dinosaur.

So what the hell am i supposed to do when I get there? Roll over and
die? If I hurt it then it just heals itself. I have steel which its
vulnerable to but only a kabar and what little steel is in the bullets i
fire. This thing is all meat, its huge.

Well, its a good day to die i guess. Stars are bright and barely a cloud
in the sky tonight. The wounds heal to the very tracks of the rounds i
fired at this thing. So yes it is vulnerable to steel. I grab my kabar
and head in. Lets dance Jiminy.

Jiminy the Demon
================

iminy the cricket from hell only just turned slightly by the time I
threw aside my firearms. I was in the air at full speed. I threw my arms
apart and extended my scythe like talons. I kinda felt like the female
wolverine Laura Kinney. My talons aren’t adamantine and yet I had a shit
eating smirk thinking about that as I pounced.

It was only a brief thought though I had some serious ass kicking to
attend to. One of his raptorial arms came up toward me and I made like
an olympic high jumper and bent over his swing slashing at his arm. The
creature roared but my hit was quickly healed over. I need to keep it
busy but the kabar is the tool that is going to get the job done here.
He can’t heal iron or steel. My talons are neither iron nor steel.

I land on it’s thorax talons first, plunging both my arms into each side
of it. Another roar and it thrashes around like a wild stallion. I’m
holding strong to it’s back as I’m thrown about, my legs thrown skyward
and my hair twirling about me. Part of it’s thorax tears loose and I
sail into a tree as it roars in pain. I use my talons to spin around a
strong branch and into the air, coming down gently using foot talons to
grab and suspend myself inversely on the same branch. I shed my skin and
go true form to allow me to fight better although my new clothes may
never forgive me. My boots for one will be cool and breezy after today.

The creature skitters around on the ground peering up and making
chirping noises. I think this is my chance. I grab my kabar in my right
hand and ready talons in the left. The creature loses interest. As it
starts cleaning itself I have a break in the action. I’m getting rather
hot in this uniform. I haven’t worn anything since my change so for now
I take off the uniform keeping my weapons close. A get myself closer and
grabbing my kabar I release from the branch and land the blow above the
thorax but not quite to the brain as I wanted.

Suddenly the creature leaps to the treetops taking me with it, the
thorax parts revealing wings and it flies straight up. I hold on rather
than fall but after a few hundred feet have come between me and the
ground I’m thinking maybe falling a hundred feet may have been the best
option after all.

Only a fool fights in a burning house, I can’t kill this thing if it
means I’m going to fall hundreds of feet to the ground. Oh sure I might
just heal up from it but I’ll still feel it and at this height the force
of the fall might sent me straight to hell whole and in person. It is
still bucking against my presence so I stash the kabar and strike talons
hand and foot into the creature. I’m rolling side to side and upside
down this creature can’t get enough G forces on me to throw me off.

It dives hard and cruises through treetops. I’m getting hit by leaves
and branches. One solid hit knocks my grip loose and makes the creature
scream as my talons tear into it more. Then another branch knocks all
but one arm free of the creature and it pulls up hard loosening my grip
again.

I plunge in more talons and it dives again throwing them loose, it
plunges back into the treetops and up again, my grip on the creature is
slipping. It climbs very high up in the air again and it dives. My grip
fails, and the creature is flying away. I’m falling full speed to the
ground, and there’s not a damned thing I can do to stop it. What happens
when I hit? I would presume I spatter and start regenerating but the
question is for how long? A very long time indeed. The sun would likely
end me when it rises unless a footsoldier ended me with paranormal
munitions like a jar. There isn’t anything absolute about being
immortal, just because I can heal anything doesn’t mean I can’t be
doomed. I’m learning that quickly enough.

The dawn is starting to erupt on the horizon, I can feel myself burning.
I hate what I am. I want this existence to end I tried to save my world
but I only led it to disaster. I gave my life for nothing. I shouldn’t
be here. As the ground became closer I could picture it as paradise. A
final escape to a senseless existence. What am I even doing here? I
could convince myself I was some kind of hero but everywhere I go is
death and who’s to say I might not cause just as much death as lives I
save? I think I likely will if my every encounter is like this. It never
ends.

Yet I’ve always made it out somehow. I think it might in fact be futile
to believe that I can just let go and die and be done with it. I did
that once to kill myself and destroy an evil empire just to become like
them. I think dying is a bad idea here. I don’t know what I might
become.

OK, so try to live we shall. How to not go schmuck, that is the
question. I have only a few seconds here. There is some dense foliage
off to my left I just need to get over there somehow. I’ve never done
freefalling, I have no idea how to navigate. I’m kicking my legs and
swinging my arms and the only thing I’m heading towards is a clearing.

Bloody hell, I’m thrashing trying to figure out how to move.

I’m thrashing and swinging my arms.

I’m kicking. I’m feeling numb. I’m feeling funny.

I’m flying. What the fuck. The pressure I was in forced a new change on
me. I got within seconds of the treetops and felt myself pull up like I
grew a second set of legs. Not legs, wings. I can feel the rhythm of
wings now, working involuntarily like any person might breath.
Controllable but automatic.

I flutter in to land at my belongings. Screw the insectoid, I wouldn’t
get anything out of that fight anyway. If others got in the way they
would get hurt. I’ll splatter the bug later if I can. I use a mirror
from my pack to look at myself. I must be damn near ten feet tall this
way. I’m me, literally. I look older than my previous form which is a
snapshot of the way I looked a decade ago. My skin has a slick sheen to
it. I have wings, feathered and black. With my normal complexion I’m
dark anyway so it all matches well. All in all I look like some kind of
fallen angel, beautiful and muscular and naked as the day I was born.

I grabbed the cloak-tent the insectoid was wearing and used it as a kind
of olive drab tunica.

Ok then I came into this actually not to beat up a random insect demon
but rather to save some people who were under attack by them. I need to
see if they got away OK. I need to change back human again so I don’t
freak anybody out. I’m not hungry so I won’t need to worry about that.
So I change back to human, and throw the cloak over myself to protect me
from the morning sun. Oh God I’m so hungry. I need to feed right now,
then I’ll save the rest. My nose is in the air, smelling out prey. I see
in the area immediately ahead where I first seen the demon there are two
live humans. I dash in and make the kill. Being satisfied enough I shake
off the need and go to save the other one. She is smiling and stroking a
necklace with a set of red court fangs on it, whispering something
profound. I say, “Are you all right?”

“Is Daniel OK? My friend over there? He’s going to make it I know it.
He’s so strong.”

I shake my head sadly.

“Oh no! Oh Daniel. You’ve been so brave.”

She has a necklace of red court vampire fangs. Eyes full of tears she
holds it up and holds her head on it.

She proceeded to describe how she was being stupid in her curiosity and
made the creature take notice. Daniel was the one who tried to fight off
the creature and save her. I feel like a real asshole. I change the
subject.

“Are there any more of you?”

“There are six of us left altogether. My name is Jill.”

“Who are the others?”

“Jack, he is a big guy with a flat top haircut. Don’t go to him, let him
come to you. Vinny, the italian guy. He was with the fellowship once,
but became lost. George, he’s a gay stereotype. Craig, he is tall, lanky
and unkept. He’s also very awkward and clumsy with a stutter. Veronica,
who is a real princess, terrified of everything. She would wash her
hands all day long to keep germs off. Finally there is Laura, she has no
hair. She is always in pain, it’s so sad. I hope she finds someone it
would make it so much better for her.”

I say “Oh. Cool.” Then begin a little smirk that ended in a smile. I’ve
found some company on my quest. I say, “Do you think they will accept
me?”

She said, “absolutely! You are a very strong and good soldier, and we
could use a soldier. The closest we have is Jack and he is more of a
suicidal berserker.”

“Well done deal then, are we able to catch up and find them?”

“We have an emergency rendezvous. We are travelling south to a large
fellowship encampment. It moves around a lot but I hope it is still
hidden away there, some fellowship soldiers we moving that way a couple
days ago and said where it was. The rendezvous point is due north, about
a kilometer. Are you OK to travel?”

“I think the question is are you OK to travel. You are a fright girl,
with your clothes torn up.”

“Sadly that’s the way it is for me. It wasn’t the encounter but rather
that I’m a hobo like the rest of us. We work long enough for food but
then need to move on. All of us are disabled or ill in some way and
can’t hold down a job much less be accepted by any town.”

Now I really feel like an evil bastard. I ate one of these poor people.
I say, “Well off we go then I guess.”

“For sure lets get going. They will probably be heading this way in a
day anyway so we will probably meet up. That tent cloak, can we use it?”

“Yeah, it’s a glorified tarp, blocks light and likely will hold up to
wind and rain quite well. I figure it’s a two man size.”

“Great! Let’s rest the day out of the sun and start tonight. We can just
throw it over us so you can stay out of the sun. Er, I mean, get some
rest you must be exhausted after that fight.”

“Umm, yeah. Tired. Ok.” How does she know about the sun? Does she know
something about me? She doesn’t seem afraid so I guess not.

I say, “Jill, what is that odd necklace you wear?”

“Oh, please don’t be offended, I used to be a red court thrall. My last
master was slaughtered by the fellowship by fire, and I harvested his
fangs and wore them under my clothes. After the cataclysm when the reds
were destroyed I wore them exposed to remember. I have had two masters,
the first beat and tortured me, many of my fellow thralls died
needlessly in his service. He traded me to my second master in exchange
for some service. My second master was cruel but did no more than beat
us, and only for reasons he seen fit to do so. I suffered under him but
not like the first and he provided me the venom I needed to stay well
even as I provided him my own lifeblood that kept him nourished. It is a
symbiotic relationship really.”

My stomach turned at her words, but I tried not to show it. “You are
addicted though, that’s why you revere him right?”

“I’ve been through my withdrawal, I revere him because he was my
medicine. I have a mental illness and no medicine helped me. His essence
kept me in balance. You cannot possibly comprehend the suffering I
endured before I was enthralled, everything I’ve endured with the reds
pales in comparison to the suffering of my sickness. I am indebted to
them, and since the cataclysm long for their return that I may find
wellness again. I hope it doesn’t offend you. All of us were enthralled,
all of us survived the withdrawal, and all of us are becoming sick
again. Do you understand?”

“Honestly I can’t understand. I can accept what you say though in the
deepest sadness.”

“Let’s rest then until sunset.”

So we did. She was out in the sunrise without burning so I believe her.
I’m worried about the fact she wants to keep me from the sun. Did she
see me kill Daniel? As we rested she spooned me. It was a little
uncomfortable that she wanted to get so close. I was worried that she
was some manner of phobophage that I didn’t know so I looked at her with
vampire sight. This is something I had even as an infected. I learned to
gain control of it back then and it turns darkness to a kind of
twilight. The sight has a number of additional features since my change,
uncountable features that I don’t understand. I know what a human looks
like with this new sight though and she is definitely human. I can feel
the warmth of human lifeforce from a distance as well and that lifeforce
is definitely in her. I get the feeling she may be trying to tempt me.
Either she is lesbian or she wants me to drink. I won’t make
assumptions.

“A little close there Jill, I appreciate the comfort you are giving me
and I sure don’t want to put you off but I really would only like to be
friends. Out here though a person could use deep friendships to deal
with this post-apocalyptic nightmare. Are you OK with that?”

“Uh, sorry I didn’t mean to– oooOOOOooo right gotcha sorry, my mistake.
Of course I’ll be a friend.”

“What did you do before coming here, I mean, like before getting
enthralled.”

“I was a lifecoach. I worked with some of the greatest people in
hollywood. I inspired them, listened to their woes and gave sage advice.
When I started getting sick I started falling into psychosis and my sage
advice started getting more and more profound. The trust my clients had
in me leant them to believe me when I spoke of aliens, pending
invasions, hidden knowledge in physics research being held from the
world by corrupt governments. They were wearing talismans I made for
them, drinking potions and burning odd incense. It was only after I was
picked up wandering the streets spewing word salad that they took me to
the hospital for treatment. No drug worked I was in there a couple years
crying, screaming, sedated, in electroshock therapies. Yet what was
going on inside was far worse than what could be seen, unless someone
lived it they could never know. A kind hearted nurse was infected and
made her first kill in there. She changed, she became the opposite of
what she was, cruel, heartless, powerhungry. She took me as a thrall
because I was convenient and travelled south to her new people. I guess
everything else was history. I was well as a thrall as I said before and
even with my addiction broken I would give my life for that medicine
again.”

“My story is rather different. I was a journalist writing stories about
the paranormal. I snuck into a vampire ball with the love of my life, a
wizard. The ball was for the promotion of a female vampire to nobility.
She had a grudge with my wizard and infected me to tear us apart. It
did. I was afraid I might kill him so I joined the fellowship down here.
My daughter was abducted by the reds and I came to set her free before
she was sacrificed. I lost control and made my first kill. I started
changing, my lover killed me as a sacrifice and since it was a bloodline
curse the reds, all of them, died. It worked because I was the youngest
full red court vampire yet my change did not complete. The vampire part
died so like other younger fellowship members I just got cured. Then I
just came back to life. Sort of. I guess. I really don’t know, so sue
me.”

“Sort of?”

“I’m not quite the same. I’m still human by nature, I think like a
human. I’m not corrupted I don’t think. Honestly I’m still learning. I’m
not a red, and I’m figuring out what I actually am.”

She seemed to deflate somehow. Not being a true red court vampire she
figures I’m no cure for her ills and I just don’t know about myself. I
don’t know if I could help her. I sure don’t want to enthrall her out of
chance, I abhor the practise.

She said, “That’s lucky for you. I hope you find your path in life and
use your new nature to help people who most need it.” I think that was a
poke at me to give it a try just on the chance I might help her. I just
won’t do it.

She said, “Well, if I ever do find my vampire despite all facts to the
contrary I would be a loyal and caring thrall for them. They would not
need for anything if I could provide it to them.” She kissed me on the
cheek, rolled over and went to sleep. She slept like a baby and I just
laid there. I’m conflicted.

I guess I could try. It’s just for me, it’s almost like euthanasia. It’s
horrible. I’ve seen so much down here, I’ve seen the horrors of
enthrallment and the treatment of thralls. Based on what I’ve
encountered so far though I really need help. I could mislead myself in
believing I’m a one woman panzer and ready to plow through all enemies
to get to my destination, but if fate hadn’t intervened I would be dead
now. I’m not an island. If there were others with me they could have
distracted that thing and I could have had a chance to sink in my kabar
where it mattered. So I need to move north with Jill and meet these new
comrades, assuming they will take me on. Jill to her credit is really
snuggling up to me. Literally. She thinks I may be her salvation and the
others may think the same. I would say I’m a shoein. The trouble is they
may do exactly as Jill and snuggle in to entice me. Jill will
undoubtedly reveal to them I may have the old red court juice they feel
the need so much. So I would need to make kills. I would have to avoid
enthralling them by staying fed some other way. If there were enough
encounters I might not even need to make a kill just sip as I go along.
I would not addict anyone. Jill told of her suffering though, I’m not
sure if that’s fair. I guess the only thing is to try. Honestly try to
avoid feeding at all. It could work, just push my boundaries, maybe I
can break the cycle of feeding somehow. I need to try refraining from
feeding as much as I can, the need to feed covertly will help. So feed
only if I have to then. Night comes, I make sure my bag is packed and
fold the cloak tent to wear. I give Jill a hug and she purrs. The two of
us head north to meet her people.

Death is everywhere now. We seem not to hardly travel a half mile
without seeing one corpse if not more. I hope they aren’t black court
victims but even if they aren’t these people are still dead. Some are
suicides, others killings, some have been eaten by things natural and
unnatural. Things unearthly show the signs of their passing raising the
hair on our heads. There are things in this part of the world now that
can only be said to be wrong. Just wrong in the sense that there are
things that simply should not be walking these fields of slaughter.

I may not feel that I can morally provide them the venom they feel they
need but that doesn’t mean I can’t be part of their group. Why would
they even know about the vampiric part of me anyway, not unless they see
me feed.

Jill said, “We always pick a place to meet every mile or so. We found
this old abandoned hunting cabin as a waypoint so we could flee back to
it and meetup.” We passed out of the underbrush and found the cabin some
twenty to thirty feet away. Jill went first and her crew turned around
to greet her and I came right behind her.

There was a low powerful roar from what looked like a real life rambo,
“mugger!” Then I heard Jill yell back, “No Jack! She’s OK it’s our new
friend Susan!” Too late. Just to illustrate how goddamned powerful Jack
is he had a tree up by it’s roots and thrown towards me before Jill’s
words registered. I leaped backwards as the tree flew within inches of
my nose. I felt like I was in the movie matrix, the adrenaline slowed
everything down to the point it felt like an hour for me to hit the
ground on my back. I rolled over to face Jill’s people, most of whom
with their eyes wide as saucers were asking me, “My God are you OK?” I
walked toward them carefully, and said, “Jesus Christ!” without meeting
Jack’s gaze. I was thinking about wolves and how meeting the alpha male
gaze is considered a challenge. I don’t want to challenge Jack, it might
hurt.

Another one walked toward me and said, “Fucking ass, Oi, Fuck.” He
extended his hand smiling in order to shake mine but somehow seemed to
be genuinely greeting me. As if something was shortcircuited in his
greeting mechanism.

Another guy came towards me skipping like a little girl and clapping his
hands, “Oh you have such a wonderful complexion! Your outfit is sooo
embarrassing but that hair is to die for! Where do you get it done girl?
My name is George” He came right up bypassing the handshake and hugged
me tight, kicking up one leg.

One girl wouldn’t look at me but rather asked Jill, “Oh my God Jill, did
you wash her before you decided to take her home? You don’t know where
she came from!” to which I responded back, “I flew out her ass.” The
girl turned back to me and said, “You bitch, who invited you here?” Jill
looked at me and said, “Here is Veronica. I realize she is difficult but
she is a tad paranoid.” I said, “I can tell.”

One girl was bent over wearing welders equipment, modifying a rocket
launcher. She said, “Quiet, my plans are nearly complete. With correctly
enhanced ordinance we will finally conquer and rule this land!” She
would seem to be some sort of evil mastermind. Always helps to have a
pet super-villain on duty.

Then finally a tall lanky fellow walks clumsily toward me. He trips, his
rifle goes off, the bullet hits a tree limb above his head which then
falls. Then it hits him on the head knocking him flat to the ground. The
rest of us dive for the ground not realizing at first where the gunshot
came from. Once we perceived what happened Jill said to him, “Oh Craig,
always the same with you isn’t it dear.” All I could say was, “Oh
Christ.” What a motley crew Jill’s people are.

Introductions done, Jill said, “Well it’s getting towards sunrise so why
don’t we go into the cabin and rest today. We can head out tonight where
are you going Susan we’ll tag along and keep each other safe?”

“Well the best I can figure I’m going to head south, I want to get the
hell out of here to somewhere that’s safer. I or we can do a lot more to
help here from outside, if we stay the only thing we can do is die. If
not today, eventually, and soon.”

“Agreed then. Veronica I want you to put sheets up on the windows to
keep the sun out so we can rest. Make sure not a ray of sun enters in on
us.”

Veronica said, “Why would you bother to block the windows none of us
have ever cared one way or the other—” Jill looked unwaveringly at
Veronica and her eyes lit up. She said, “OOOooo, really? Well damn
you’re right we never sleep right in sunlight do we. Excellent idea.”

The rest of the people looked at each other unsure of what that exchange
was about and then I could then see the slow realization in their faces
like a man having walked through a desert discovering a babbling brook.
Nobody let me in on the wonderful news though. Maybe it’s better I just
didn’t know. Way down I feel like I already know the creepy truth.

That first day everyone talked to me like I was the cool kid in school,
wanting me to like them and working hard at it. It gave me a chance for
us to get to know each other and I considered it a good thing.

The next day I was walking with Laura as we were heading south. The
first thing she did of course is curse having such a simple-minded
companion, and then said at least Jack might prove useful. Between her
and George it’s going to be a very affectionate journey.

“So then…, you like the clean look? I mean clean shaved head. It’s
cool.” I said.

“Well actually, it wasn’t that long ago, well actually it was quite a
long time ago, I fought my way through cancer. There is quite a bit of
pain even now and my hair never grew back. Being, Er, of use to the reds
relieved the trouble. No pain, regained my hair. They were evil, that I
know, yet I miss them. Part of me wants them back.” said Laura.

She seemed unexpectedly forward, like she is actually trying to connect
with me unlike how she treats the others. I say, “Man that sucks. What’s
everyone hoping to find south of here?”

Laura said, “Well, I can’t speak for everyone but for me I hope either
the fellowship encampment south has found a way to replace the need for
the red court people have, or I will attempt to find the answer. That
way I can fulfill my manifest destiny to rule. Unless of course I can
find someone who can help me in a more old fashioned way.”

“Like a different diet you mean?” I said.

“No I make sure to eat well, I’m clean, no diseases and I take good care
of myself. I’m good and healthy and…” Laura said.

It creeped me out a bit when she turned to me with an overly warm smile.
I shrank away, and slipped over to chat with Craig. He turned his head
toward me and smiled as I approached. The side of his head hit a branch
as he walked. He arched his torso back like a high jumper and flailed
his arms one of which grabbed hold of the trunk of the tree. He wrapped
himself around the trunk then spun off it like a dancer who just
executed a dip. Finally having pulled himself back up he straightened
his collar and continued on loose legged like he just put on a show for
my entertainment. Admittedly I was entertained, curling up a little
smirk due to the little spectacle. Amazing. Like a real life Kramer in a
way.

“Hey Craig wassup?” I said.

“Nuttin’ much. Hows you?” He said.

“So what’s your story? What did you do for a living before stuff
happened?” I said.

Craig hung his head in sorrow. “Once, a lifetime ago, I was a doctor. I
was a neurosurgeon in fact, sought after by every cancer patient in Los
Angeles. Celebrities and tech tycoons from all over the country, hell
all over the world were knocking at my door. When I was enthralled my
master sought to teach me the evil of too much sugar in his coffee and
beat me about the head with the leg of a coffee table. Something was
damaged, I have no balance, spasms, falling all over myself. I was
better when I was fed from, and I needed it regularily in order to have
some semblance of a normal life. I wonder if he knew what he was doing
would make me all that much more dependant on him? Probably not. He
wouldn’t care either way, I was just a dog for him to beat.”

Craig kicked the dirt, grabbed a large tree branch and threw it far into
the darkness of the night.

I felt like shit. I tried not to think of the fact that I inherited much
of the red court legacy. It would be such a glorious thing to be rid of
it all. I timidly put my hand on his shoulder and patted him in an
awkward attempt to comfort his anger.

“I really can’t say I can understand, that would be insulting. They have
hurt me too Craig. I had a wonderful guy and my infection tore us apart.
I fought down here for a decade and by the time we met again we were
almost strangers. At the last day at I was left for dead. I hope to meet
him again, find my little girl and start my life again. That’s my story,
so far. God it sucks down here.”

Craig said, “No shit. I thought it was bad before the fall of the reds
but we hadn’t seen nothing like the hell that we see now. The worst
atrocities in history are happening here and nobody outside of these
jungles have any idea.”

I sigh, and shake my head, and say, “It’s always been that way. Nobody
cares what happens down here. The middle east is having a melt down in
terrorism, and the whole world is watching. Is it about the oil? So
stupid. Like what has to happen down here before the world is willing to
see?” I punched a tree hard and it tore open. A twenty inch diameter
tree.

Craig said, “Damn girl, that’s quite the left hook you got there. Remind
me not to piss you off. What are you carrying with you? They touched you
somehow didn’t they? Everybody here thinks so.”

I looked at him wide eyed, “I guess I do, what are the others saying
about me? I’m getting bad vibes man.”

Craig sighed, and said, “Well, we think you might have the venom. That
maybe you could heal us. We know the reds fell, the sky was like
Armageddon. The sun eclipsed and filled with fire and lightning. We seen
them all drop, those who didn’t found out by word of mouth and the
abandonment of their strongholds. Everyone knows. If you have what we
think we will stick to you like glue and protect you to our death. You
can be sure of that.”

My heart sank. I hung my head low and said, “I don’t know what all I am
Craig, or what I can do. I’m not entirely like them, I have talons. Well
I guess maybe, well OK I am carrying their legacy in me to some degree.
I just don’t want to hurt you guys. I think it would, if I do have the
venom and I don’t know. I hope I don’t really, I could kill you if
something isn’t right with me. Maybe I might kill myself with some kind
of feedback from the attempt. I don’t know what I am Craig.”

Craig pursed his lips, and said, “You’re right, we are willing to die
but there is a remote possibility we could kill you. That isn’t what we
want. I’ll leave you alone sure enough Susan if it is as you wish but
the others are going to try to tempt you to feed, the only thing they
care about is being healthy again. I understand how they feel. I think
you might too, deep down.”

I nodded, “Yeah I do. I am conflicted over this, honestly. I don’t know
what is right here. I know the evils of the venom but I really didn’t
consider where it might heal others as well. It just doesn’t make sense
to me.”

We continued through the bush heading south, bodies in various stages of
decomposition were scattered in our path. We raided the corpses for ammo
and supplies along the way. Every so often we heard a noise and dove for
cover, only to find out it was some local fauna, and we sighed a breath
of relief.

When it was coming to morning we camped. They had a ten man canvas tent,
army issue, no light dared to either enter or leave the old monstrosity
and yet they took my canvas cloak tent and gathered it around me all the
same. I felt like a unicorn discovered by a team of zoologists,
overprotected.

Inside a small coleman lantern burned, and Jack was shoring up the tent
from the inside. As he was circling around to where I was he
accidentally got a sliver from one of the wooden spikes. More than a
sliver. He used his ka-bar to slice open his palm to remove it. Blood
splashed onto the ground. I had to cover my eyes. I whipped my head
around but the arousal of my body and animal like sniffing of the air
was apparent. I desperately tried not to but I released a vampiric hiss.
A quiet one. Jack clearly heard it though. He said, “How much longer can
you hold it lady? We’ll break you, we need what you got.” Damn. This
doesn’t sound good.

Renewed whispers rippled through the camp, and Laura snuggled up to me.
She said, “We could rule the world you know, you and I. I have the
knowledge, and the willingness to help you reconquer this land. We could
be invincible.” She bit her lip hard. A stream of blood accumulated. I
covered my eyes and convulsed, rolled over and bit down on an iron
spike. They have a kind of blood like taste, being iron and all. It
helped only a little bit. It was like hard taffy to me, which helped a
little more being something to chew on. I was sweating profusely for a
few minutes, breathing deeply to calm down, hissing gently. I’m not
going to be able to stand much more of this, it will twist my mind up.
The hunger cannot be perpetually ignored.

I just laid there, no sleep for me. I’m starting to smell them. I can
smell their humanity. I can smell their blood. Only mildly now but it
will get worse.

Later I checked my watch and it showed 12:00. Oh crap! I got everyone
up, we are way late getting going. It’s already halfway through the
night and we wasted hours with me just sitting there and them sleeping.
All of them groggy, Jill said, “What’s up Susan? We have hours before we
need to leave.

I said, “No we don’t it’s midnight already we have to go!”

She said, “What? My clock says high noon? So does Jack’s Susan. Wait! No
don’t go out!”

Vinny yelled, “I happen tire! I hat of fires ceiling the filaments!”

Jack yelled back, “Make sense goddammit man!”

Vinnie punched the ground.

Sure enough it was a bright and sunny when I leapt from the tent. I
covered myself and rolled into a ball, crouched, and was close to
leaping back for the tent. Then I realized I’m not burning now. Ever
since my transformation fighting the cricket demon I tried to enter into
that angelic form again but couldn’t. I don’t know how I did that. Yet I
believed I might be changing, growing somehow, into something unique.
Growing into a beast not before seen. It seems some part of what I
predicted is true. The fact that I’m growing and changing. As of this
moment I’m unaffected by the sun, whether or not it stays that way it’s
hard to tell.

Veronica said, “Ew. She’s going to burn up and stink up the tent.” she
tried to be quiet but my super hearing still heard her.

Jill replied to her, “My God woman, is that all you think? A noble
creature burns, an abominable event, and you’re only afraid that she
might stink?”

I relaxed my crouch and stood up. I looked skyward to see my long lost
love. I was a sun worshipper in the modern sense when I was human and
infected. Just as much when I was fully human. I would lie out in the
sun and tan endlessly.

The warmth on my skin was wonderful, it made me feel normal again. The
sun eased my hunger slightly too, but only slightly. The other members
of the crew leapt out of the tent expecting to see a smoking puddle and
seen me standing there staring up at the sun. They all hit the ground on
their knees and planted their face in the dirt. Craig smacked it on a
rock and rolled on his side groaning. A spontaneous reaction for thralls
I expect, only the most elder and powerful of the reds were daywalkers.

I stared at the sky and said, “This is new. I wonder when I became a
daywalker? It’s OK guys I’m not old. Seems like millenia but really it’s
only been days since the weird shit happened at .”

One by one they looked up, and sat there staring. I said, “I’m gonna
hang out here a while guys go back and sleep. I wanna learn more about
this if I can.”

Jack said, “Look lady this ain’t safe. If everyone’s OK with it I’m
gonna take over sentry, I got the beef to handle shit.”

George said, “I’ll do your hair, and girl you’re going to get some
exfoliation your skin needs loving too you know.”

The rest looked at each other and nodded in agreement. Whether with Jack
or George I’m not sure.

Vinnie said, “That led a missed fact, he made an ancient smear. An
affectionate malevolence.”

Jack said, “Right then, here’s the deal lady if there’s a problem I’m
putting you back in here by force if I have to. I don’t think anyone
here would disagree we would all die trying to help you if you even so
much as stubbed a toe on a rock.”

I said, “OK I hear you Jack. No prob.”

So I rolled things up and did some sunbathing. It felt so good, it seems
like it’s been a lifetime.

As I lay there I cleared my mind, pushing out all the misery of the last
few days and just taking in the warmth of the bright sun. Nothing
mattered at this moment, I’m in deep crap but I can’t do any more about
it than what I’m doing. Heading south. Heading to the encampment I knew
might not even still be there. I just hope it wasn’t relocated with the
reds gone, and that it hasn’t fallen to raiders. It’s just hope, that’s
all I can live on. We’ll change our travel to the daytime when it is
safer, now that I’m a daywalker.

Veronica was washing my face with carbolic soap. She was convinced
George’s river scum exfoliation was unsanitary. I swatted hands away
after submitting to her OCD for a few minutes.

I said, “Jack, let’s change to travel during the day. I think it would
be safer now that I’m daywalking.”

Jack said, “Any sign of trouble we go back to night travel, I’m not
putting anyone at risk most especially you kid.”

I said, “Loud and clear big guy. Let’s start tomorrow.”

He said, “Aye, if the others are good with it so am I.”

So it’s settled. I was about to rise to pack up for tonight’s voyage. We
better get going, the longer we are camped here I feel the more danger
we are in.

Jack was clinking away at the mouth of the tent field stripping his
AK-47 when I heard the brush rustle on all sides. Ghillie suits, five
soldiers in total. Safeties clicked off as they all moved at once. One
taking Jack off guard knocked him facedown to the ground and moved
swiftly back to cover him with his rifle. One came out to my side to
cover me. Three pulled up the tent pegs like they were straws and
covered my other friends who raised their hands in the air. Shouts
erupted that didn’t register to me at all. My mind was literally in the
clouds. I was pushed face first to the dirt. I could likely take them
but I would likely kill my friends doing so. We were helpless.

They searched through our belongings and found nothing more than our
weapons and survival kit. We had nothing else. They shouted at us,
saying, “Speak now! Who are you people and what is your purpose! If we
don’t like what you say we kill you and walk away with more supplies
than we came with. We don’t need any more raiders in this area. Ten
seconds starting now…”

Stay on mission
===============

o what the hell do they want to hear? I just decide to start with a
realistic description of what we are. I said, “We’re refugees for God’s
sake! Mercy, leave us be!”

“Well don’t you have brass balls. I would believe it from these
quivering wretches but you are something else. You a merc? I think so. I
have no use for rogue red court assassins. Your masters are gone, now
you die murderer.”

Veronica leaps up to defend me, “No! Don’t hurt her!” Crack! Literally
the shot heard around the world she took an AK round through the temple.
She was dead before she hit the ground. My friends all screamed and
jumped to her.

One of the gunmen said, “Cease fire, these poor wretches have been
through enough. This woman is a problem, she could kill a hundred before
she falls.”

The gunman raised his rifle and said, “Stay on mission.” The others
repeated, “Stay on mission.” The motto of the fellowship. I found them.

I said,

> I am a Fellowship Soldier.
>
> I am a Warrior and a member of a team.
>
> I serve good, and live the Fellowship Values.
>
> I will always place the mission first.
>
> I will never accept defeat.
>
> I will never quit.
>
> I will never leave a fallen comrade.
>
> I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and
> proficient in my warrior tasks and drills.
>
> I always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself.
>
> I am an expert and I am a professional.
>
> I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of humanity,
> in close combat.
>
> I am a guardian of freedom and the right way of life.
>
> I am a Fellowship Soldier.

The gunmen immediately click on the safeties of their rifles, and lower
weapons. The one gunman said, “Now that is something that never got far
from any base camp. Sorry ma’am it’s hell out here. What’s your name?”

I said, “Susan… Corporal Susan Rodriguez.”

He said, “Well good to see a sister out here Susan, I feel like shit
about that woman I’m so sorry people. We don’t know who are friends from
who are enemies out here.” Jill said, “You fucking monster, does she
look like a threat? What the hell could she have done?”

The gunman said, “Quite a lot. If she had a pistol, or worse explosive
ordinance she could have taken one or all of us down quick.”

I said, “Doesn’t make it right bud. You know my name what is yours?”

He said, “Sargeant Miller, Dwight Miller. Everyone calls me Sarg.”

“Well Sarg, just so you know, we’re all tight here and would be quick to
lay down our lives for each other. We don’t know you yet, I would like
some private time with my friends here so we can decide what to do
next.”

“Granted. You take what time you need. We are going to make camp here
for the night. We’ve been in cover for hours here observing you all and
we are tired. Especially tired given we killed an innocent today.”

“I hear you. We’ll debrief in the morning then as to where we go from
here.”

“You are welcome to travel with us if you decide so. We are heading
south to find base camp, if it is still there. Most of the fireteams
I’ve met up with are doing the same. We need to regroup and figure out
our place in this new world.”

“Who are your people then?”

“I’m Sargeant Dwight Miller; some say I look like the punisher, the
comic book anti-hero. We also have Edgar the spook Chalmers our warlock;
he’s a dishevelled millennial. Our heavy hitter is Jamar aka Jobu, like
in the old ‘Major League’ movie; He looks like Michael Clarke Duncan.
Then there’s Strength our scout; We sometimes just call him injun. The
finally there’s Doc Seth our medic, sometimes just called bones; he
looks a little like Jeremy Renner I guess.”

“Well, you don’t have that superhero physique Sarg. Otherwise I guess
sort of. Spook looks like some kind of evil hacker, are you sure he’s a
warlock and not working cyber warfare? Jamar is chiselled and not nearly
as friendly looking. Doc definately looks like Hawkeye, hands down. You
didn’t mention Injun, I guess he’s just a wiry, sure footed, long haired
native american. A small man but he is the quickest and quietest soldier
I’ve ever seen. Sarg how’d you get infected?”

“I didn’t. My wife was infected and one of her children was her first
kill. Our other children were killed immediately after. Then she fled
without a trace. I left my life to come here as a human to fight in my
families memory.”

I gasp, and rest a hand over my heart. “You wouldn’t be the first. I’m
so glad the red court is gone.”

“Perhaps, as long as I live though I will never set aside my vigilance.”

“I understand. Even if I wanted to I don’t think I ever will either. I’m
shocked you have a warlock? He’s precious as gold. You must have
anti-vampire ordinance then?”

“Or as we call it now supernatural ordinance. We have more than vampires
to worry about out here.”

“Yeah, I know. Lord do I know. Thanks Sarg, I’ll let you know what we
decide.”

“I am not going to go anywhere with those assholes. We’ll roll on our
own, I would rather fall on my sword than travel with them.”, Jill said.

Vinnie said, “I will believe to get us to be loved in a jerk or will be
lived love during when they are far. For spectacles believe they fear. A
jerk or by far. Lots by far. Lots spectacular. I will by want us in.
Want us to get ass cheeks.”

I smirk, and roll my eyes.

We were gathered around in an area not too far from our campsite, far
enough away from the soldiers we hopefully won’t be heard easily.
Without the vampire part of the fellowship, the infection, it’s much
easier to say we are out of earshot. The infected or half vampires like
I was had supernatural hearing nearly as good as full red court
vampires.

George wiped his eyes and said, “The more of us the more chance some
manner of contagion might invade the group. That’s what Veronica would
have said. I vote nay, we go it alone.”

I said, “It would be safer, we would have a better chance of getting
somewhere safe. It only makes sense.”

Jill said, “Oh yeah, so we should believe the one who lethally fed off
our friend Daniel? Sucked him dry, I seen you. I know. We all know. Here
we are and you wont damn well touch us.”

I sat there feeling surreal. This is what I worst feared. They knew.

Craig said, “Great. Thanks Jill that helped. Now we’re going to lose our
vampire and along with her all hope of getting better.”

I said, “Hello, I’m right here. I have a name you know. I didn’t think
you knew about Daniel, I’m so sorry. I know saying I was hungry doesn’t
help much. I guess I wish I could have munched a bad guy there just
weren’t any around right then. That didn’t come out right sorry.”

Jill said, “No there is no good way to say it. I know you didn’t mean
anything by it Susan it’s just the way you are. You need to feed soon
though or you are going to kill again. I’ve lived with reds long enough
to know, you need to accept us or you will kill again. It’s your nature.
I love that nature, please be the vampire you are it is a noble and
beautiful thing.” She grabs her fang necklace and holds it tenderly.

I sat there thinking. She’s right. The soldiers killed today to defend
themselves but my hunger is worsening and it will eventually make me
kill to feed. The soldiers had no choice but I do. I can’t keep on
starving myself. I have to have enough wisdom to realize if I’m stubborn
and blind to the reality of my new nature I will kill again and again. I
need to eat a regular diet so I don’t gorge myself. Just like anyone.

I sat there a moment. Then I looked at them and I said, “OK, I’ll try. I
only know to kill though. I refuse to feed in the hope I wouldn’t need
to and then I just end up killing from hunger. I’ve never fed normally.
I don’t even know if I have venom, at least not the kind you need. I’m
sorry guys I don’t know for sure what I am, I’m scared. I’m scared that
I am a monster more horrific than any of the reds could be.”

Jack said, “You’re a vamp. I don’t know how you could be a daywalker
after only having risen a few days. Maybe you have amnesia, you’re old
but can’t remember. You’re just a red though, you drink blood. I don’t
care what Jill said, wings and talons and such. She tells long tales.”

I look at Jack and raise my arms. I give him a little smirk in the hope
he is not going to attack me and then I extend my talons. Everyone
except Jill jumps back. Jack pulls up his fists then backs down.
Everyone looks at Jill. Jill said, “I told you. It’s all true she took
on that thing, changed to some kind of vengeful angel and drove it off.
There’s her talons like I said. It was all true.”

I said, “If you want me to try feeding I will. You can see now I’m not
any red that any of us have ever seen. I’m not the same. So you know
feeding is a risk. I still say we need to join the soldiers. It’s not
about whether they are worthy or not, it is not about what happened to
Veronica. She would not like us putting ourselves in danger just in
stubborn defiance especially for the sake of her memory. You know that.
I’m starting to realize my abstinence has been putting your lives in
danger too. So if I’m taking the risk with feeding, please take the risk
in joining with the soldiers. These are fellowship soldiers, not mercs.
It’s not for sure we are safe with them, they may have forsaken their
oath but at least the fellowship *has* an oath.”

Laura finally piped in and said, “I agree. These soldiers give us an
excellent strategic advantage in our plans. I will follow them. The odds
are well placed. It is less likely they will betray us than other men of
war and that possibility weighs well against the tactical defensibility
they would provide.”

Jill said, “Agreed then. We follow them. Let’s camp for the night. Laura
it’s your turn to tantalize the vampire.”

Vinnie chuckled, then said, “Provide for the lift of the need to cause
food. If takes for Life and heinous food, in the chef nutty nutty nutty
impact. Heals needs thy Food, nutritious for lift of thrones ornate
food, nutty Food. To top the need for methyl of their cough, if youth
for continuous.”

Laura said, “Understood.”

I snorted and laughed.

Then I let out a kind of maniacal giggle, thinking of willingly taking
thralls. I’m not entirely able to accept the reality quite yet. I have
thralls. Whether or not I choose to feed from them they will follow me.
Jesus. I have thralls.\
That night Laura snuggled up to me. I nuzzled her for a while,
slobbering on her like a dog. She started giggling and moaning, when she
started falling limp I was aroused to feed big time. Then I just let go
and bit and fed from Laura. She let out a deep gasp and moaned intensely
in pleasure. I heard Jill from the other side of the tent, “Thank God.
It’s about time.”

Vinnie said, “Thunder cheese.”

![image](Images/hrule.png)

I let the Sarg know we decided to accompany them. He made the order to
make ready to escort the refugees south with them to freedom. Or
hopefully so.

He said, “Strength take point.”

A quick and silent native warrior said, “Aye.” and slithered into the
forest silently and quickly. So silent I couldn’t hear him myself with
my vampiric hearing. Amazing.

Sarg said, “Jamar take rear.”

A huge african-american bear with ma deuce broke his way to the back.

Sarg said, “Seth stay with the people, make sure they aren’t wounded.”

A man that looked like Dr. Strange from the comic books, grey at the
temples, moved amongst my friends to check them. He’s a medic, he
carried medical gear.

Sarg said, “Edgar stay with me, corporal Susan same stay here. Spook we
need more jars, we deployed too many on those blacks a few weeks ago and
haven’t got any back yet.”

Spook looked like the epitomy of the lanky greasy haired computer
hacker.

Spook said, “Aye. Susan do your people have any jars? Like literally
empty jars of any kind?”

I asked, we had a dozen in the unlikely case we found a warlock. Freaky,
we actually did.

We started out. Laura had no interest in world domination today. She
looked like a teenage girl in love. She would steal glances at me from
time to time and was just generally in her own happy place. I’m not one
to talk though, I felt the same. When we made camp for lunch that day we
sat together. I noticed the venom caused a vampiric reaction on her skin
searing it. I cooled it with a rag and some water. She is going to make
sure to cover her neck and upper torso from the sun to protect herself.

“I should have known better. The venom always kinda turns skin vampiric.
It’s just been so long since I’ve provided to my master.” she giggled,
“you were wonderful Susan thank you.”

She snuggled in with me as the lunch was being cooked at the fire and I
felt a rush of joy go through me from her touch. Like that being young
and in love feeling. It was great. It made no sense. I just don’t care,
it feels so innocent and wonderful. I held her close and kissed her
tenderly on the cheek. I love this.

Everyone seen us, and we made no attempt to hide anything. My friends,
or, thralls, were looking very confused. I heard one soldier say to
Sarg, “Uh, Sarg. I think our new corporal is. Uh. You know. Like playing
for the other te—”

“They look happy. I’m glad. How much longer for lunch, how are our
rations…”

Jill came up to us and asked Laura, “Girl, does it feel the same? Is the
venom as it should be?”

Laura said, “Perfect, feels exactly the same. Exactly what we need Jill,
Susan’s a keeper for sure.”

Jill said, “Uh Susan, you’re acting a little bit different from what you
should. What are you feeling right now?”

I told her what I could about how I felt.

Jill said, “Susan have you ever been fed on, ever?”

I said, “No, I just got turned as far as I remember.”

Jill said, “It’s just that what you’re feeling mirror the effects of the
venom with only a few differences. What happened at the turning?”

I said, “Dear God. Well if you want to know grab something to vomit in.”

So I proceeded to recollect my experience of the turning, and my
thoughts about it.

Jill held a hand to her mouth and looked a little green. She said, “Oh
Jesus. I didn’t know it happened like that. My God that’s disgusting.
They threw your beau in the room for you to eat? Who pissed off the red
you or him?”

I said, “Him. He is good at pissing people off.”

She said, “God, were they ever vindictive. I’m so glad they’re gone. I
want them back again but not like that. If only they could be the noble
creatures I know they are deep down. Like you. You’re definitely a
keeper Susan you’re a sweetheart.” She smiled and rubbed her fang
necklace, snuggling it to her cheek.

I said, “I already killed two people Jill, your friend and some random
dude driving down a road. I don’t think sweetheart applies.”

She said, “All things are relative. The reds were really awful, you
aren’t. You are still a vampire Susan. A predator of humans. Apparently
the definition of thrall with you has become a human who dedicates
themselves to the proper feeding, care and protection of a vampire. What
a brave new world it is. The slaves are the keepers of their master.”

We talked for a while, and came to the conclusion that I’ve established
a telepathic link to Laura and am sharing her pleasure. Nonetheless at
the time of feeding I still had to contend with the mania, until it
settled into this sense of connectedness. We noticed a difference, my
connection to Laura showed a dominant aspect. I want to protect her. She
wants to please me. There is a bond of love between us. George said it
was the natural thrall relationship of love restored. He said that it is
based on the trust of a big strong wonderful vampire. He said me and
Laura are going to have a beautiful and eternally loving relationship.
That’s George, he sure has a flair for the dramatic.

![image](Images/hrule.png)

After a few days had gone by, I have had a feed from all the thralls. We
all feel interconnected and on top of the world. We have a telepathic
bond of some sort. The soldiers are suspicious but can’t seem to put
their finger on it, or at least we haven’t been confronted.

We heard a hell of a racket close to camp, everybody leapt up.

A person raising a war cry, roaring of great beasts. Trees are crashing
down and yells of pain. Someone outside, one of our team, is in a life
and death battle with a great monster. Or perhaps many such monsters.
They need help urgently.

Me and Craig were in the middle of the joy of feeding me. Needless to
stay we stopped cold and were working furiously cleaning ourselves up.
Jill and Laura helped. He was intoxicated and fell back to the sleep
roll. We explained to the soldiers he hasn’t felt well tonight. Sarg is
worried we might need to stay camped an extra day, or drag a stretcher
tomorrow.

Sarg said, “Who’s on sentry?”

I said, “Jack. Oh God Jack.”

I heard gasps from my thralls behind me.

Craig said, “He’ll be fine. He is getting his senses back now.”

Everybody looked straight at Craig, then the thralls looked at me, and
all the thralls raised eyebrows and smiled.

Jill said, “It’s working.”

Sarg said, “What? What’s working?”

Jill said, “The increased fibre in my diet, I’m more regular now.”

Sarg said, “Jesus fu— Nevermind, you clowns stay here. Grab your gear
men and get ready to engage.”

It was getting quiet as soon as the soldier left. Soon we heard the
call, “OK people, it’s safe to exit the tent. Conan the barbarian
butchered some Jaguars.”

I said, “Pardon?”

Me and the thralls left and headed to where the soldiers are. Jaguars?
Plural? The hell? We seen quite the sight. It definately looked like a
Frank Frazetta sketch. Jack took down six fricking jaguars with fist and
kabar. His shirt and pants were torn and his massive bodybuilder
physique shined with sweat. Blood trickled from his breast with what
precious few injuries he had taken. I turned my eyes away from him,
between the trickling blood and that outrageous body I was getting two
or three different kinds of hungry.

Jack said, “I was cool in the fight. I’m not berserking anymore. I was
hungry for the battle, and fought with strength and skill, but my wits
were about me. I’m me again. Thank God, and thank you Susan. Thank you
so much.”

Sarg said, “For what? What is he thanking you f—”

I said, “—Sarg, all things considered do you *really* want to know?”

Sarg said, “No. Actually no, that’ll do just fine.”

I said, “Sarg, I’m moving up with you and your boys. Jaguars aside our
own personal X-man Wolverine can take care of the thr— er, civilians.”

Sarg said, “Granted. It will be good working with you.”

We need to keep moving south quietly. The last thing we need is to have
some hostile force come down on us due to some territorial bullshit.
Soon after that thought a bullet hit a tree and we hit the dirt. We need
to take care of this quickly. I found my telepathic link to the thralls
was strong now, strong enough for open communication.

I said telepathically, *“Hit the dirt people, we have inbound fire
here.”*

Jack said, *“Damn. Hear you loud and clear. Bloody amazing. Everybody
Down!”*

Everybody answered in their minds tongue. I listen for activity; there
is something on the road. The road is 500 yards out; I hear a vehicle. I
said, “Stay down Sarg, I’m gonna look.”

Sarg said, “Aye.”

It’s an APC, about a dozen soldiers around it. It looks like militia but
they are probably raiders.

I said, “Sarg, looks like a dozen. Irregular troops, trained civies. An
APC also. If you don’t have anything I have a 20mm rifle with incendiary
rounds for the APC.”

Jack transmitted by thought, and said *“I have movement due south of us
Susan. Sounds like a rabbit but if there is something up there it could
very well be hostiles down here also.”*

*“I hear you Jack, I’ll listen to see what it is.”*, I said to Jack.

“There is something in the bushes around our people Sarg, I might be
able to find out what it is.”

Sarg said, “How the hell do you know that? Never mind. Do your shit.” I
listen 150 yards away, where the thralls are, and I hear something like
a housecat, moving silently. Or almost so. I squint my eyes in
concentration and hear the breathing. A large animal. I hear a whisper,
“Alpha tango, target appears to be refugees. I see nothing of value
except supplies.” I don’t hear the reply but in the bush the voice of
the hostile soldier returns, “Aye, order understood.”

I said to Sarg, “They’re checking us out, it sounds like raiders. They
may not realize our people are distant from us. I believe they may think
our people are the whole of our contingent when the troops on the road
fired at us thinking we were the same group. This may work to our
advantage if they don’t know there are organized fellowship soldiers
within reach. I say we start to move back slowly Sarg, I will try and
gather more intel on the way.”

Sarg said, “What the fuck are you using for intel woman? You got some
cybernetic implants I don’t know about? We are going to have a real come
to Jesus conversation soon if you don’t come clean. Agreed, we stealth
south to our people.”

Another shot hit an inch from the soldier Jamar’s head.

I said, “The force on the road is trying to keep us down. Likely it’s in
order to allow the team south of our people to make their strike.”

Sarg said, “How can you you deduce that? Were you working intelligence?”

I said, “Yeah actually. I was a journalist before infection so that
became part of my duty. Intelligence, counter-intelligence,
infiltration, special ops.”

He said, “Ok. I’ll run with it then. Wait, you’re special ops? Do you
mean you’re a ‘Snake Eater?’”

I said, “Um, yeah. I was on some international assignments. I’m from the
special forces personnel.”

He said, “Fuck. Can you ease Joe Boo’s troubles back there?”

I said, “Aye Sarg, I’ll get it done.”

I moved over that 150 yards in five seconds slithering through the
underbrush, like a wild stallion on a straight stretch. I reached Joeboo
snapping off his pistol to keep the enemy down, only to draw return
fire. He is hit in his left shoulder so likely won’t be able to wield
the ma deuce but it’s hard to say.

I said, “What’s out there?”

He jumped back and got a radio call. Over the radio Sarg said, “Joeboo
I’m sending Susan your way. Found out she’s a snake eater give her a
wide berth to work her craft out there.”

Joeboo said, “Yeah. She’s here now.” Sarg said, “What the f—, Jesus!”

It sounded like a hive of bees the bullets were flying so close. As I
was there Joe Boo took two in the chest and went flat. I took one in the
shoulder as I went down beside him, casting an oath as I went.

“Jobu how bad is it?” his eyes were wide and glassy. I opened his
fatigues and he was bleeding badly. Deadly badly. Damn me to hell it
looked yummy. I had to look away. I was drooling like a dog again.

“I’ll get you help Jamar, somehow I’ll get Bones here.”

“Too weak… need to get that bullet out…, Susan please try. My medkit has
surgical supplies…” He nearly passed out, I shook him, “Jamar stay with
me, come on man stay with me!”

He said, “…supplies. Dig and stitch. You remember training? Just try.”

I got his medkit. Why he had a field surgeons kit I may never know but
his was complete. I got sanitizing wipes, scalpel, tweezers, and more. I
tried, I didn’t know how to stop the bleeding. Without stopping the
bleeding I didn’t know how to see to remove the bullet. I can’t stitch
him without removing the bullet. I still remember enough from my
training to know Jamar is a dead man with this much bleeding even if I
did get a patch to suck the chest wound. I can’t stand the hunger
anymore, I set aside the tools. I said, “I’m sorry Jamar. I thought I
could do this, I don’t know how.”

Jamar looked at me with empty eyes as I leaned in to finish him off. I’m
drawing his blood through his wound. I inadvertantly drew the bullet out
from feeding. Scalpel be damned I extended a talon and removed the
bullet with exacting precision. More precision than even the best
surgeon could ever do. I had the steady reflexes of a vampire using an
extension of her own body to do her work. I grabbed some stitching and
pulled it through quick as a sewing machine using my talons.

I noticed the areas I touched with my venom during feeding were not as
inflamed as they were so I used the venom like an antiseptic as I closed
up the wound. I used the shirt from his fatigues to wrap him and keep
the venom soaked skin out of the sun and out of the danger of burning.
It also worked as a anesthetic as well as soothing him and bringing him
pleasure. I tried not to use too much in fear of addicting him.

I said, “Jamar, I need to take down these motherfuckers so you lie like
the dead until I get back. Don’t forget to stay alive because if you
don’t I’ll kill you OK?” Jamar laughed, “No promises I’ll try.”

I said, “There is no try—”

He said, “only do or not do. OK I will.”

He looked at me as I left. Confusion maybe, no emotion at all; he just
stared. As if he was trying to look inside me; as if he was trying to
figure out what I truly am.

Then I listened. Facing to our groups rear I’m looking north. 150 yards
out, a rustle in a bush 10 degrees left, then a short burst coming from
45 degrees right, and the sound of a mag being changed 30 degrees left.
I hear a small group 300 yards distant, rustling, rattling and some but
not much incoming fire. OK what’s around here, pretty open to the north,
and to the east the treeline opens to a field leading to the road. West
there’s a depression. I walk over to the depression and find it’s a
stream bed, not much stream though. I slip into the depression and
listen north, a slight rustle, no inbound fire. One soldier it sounds
like. I look and they’re 300 yards out and hidden well. I caught the
sight of their earring. I make my way quickly and quietly and take the
soldier down quickly. using a talon in the lung they couldn’t scream and
fangs to the neck made it a deadly feeding. I hid the body well. Looking
to the east I see the four behind a very large fallen tree. These people
are well armed! If they move forward Sarg will never get back in time to
save my thralls.

Using telepathy I said, *“You guys have got to move out now! Grab what
you can and get to the Sargeant! These people back here are formidable.
They will plow through our rear guard and all of you right quick.”*

My thralls replied, *“We’re moving now Susan, we’ll get forward to the
Sergeant as fast as we can.”*

If I fire off my M16, with the tiny little 5.56 rounds I won’t penetrate
the tree. The 20mm would punch through the tree and take one down, at
this range it would surgically punch through the tree, one soldier, and
a hundred yards of trees down the line fire would have perfect little
holes until the last one has a fiery explosion. That’s no good. Besides
I could drive them forward rather than back if I open fire from here.
They know Jamar is the only one between them and their target and if
taken on multiple fronts they will go for Jamar or flee. With him
injured I doubt they will flee. I need to make them run or dig in.
Scaring the bejesus out of them should do the trick. Facing a vicious
unseen predator should do it if I can be terrifying enough. I’ve decided
then, I must eat.

At the thought my vision changed. It darkened and became clearer, like a
good pair of sunglasses. I was also seeing beyond normal vision, the
colours and aspects of true vampire vision. I shook my head and closed
my eyes for a moment and it was still the same. I had a small mirror I
used for camouflage face paint. I looked at my eyes and they weren’t
human. They weren’t the pure black of a red court vampire either they
were a terrifying pure white. They seemed to glow in the light of the
sun. I forced my eyes closed and did what I could to calm my hunger a
little. I looked again and something swooshed towards the bridge of my
nose and my human eyes returned. Well shit, I seem to have nictitating
membranes. They pulled out to protect my vampiric eyes for a daylight
hunt. I’ve never seen that in any red or any supernatural species I know
of. I wonder if that’s why Jamar looked at me funny. Things are going to
get weird if we all get through this alive. I crouch down moving in
silently, not even so much as a leaf or a twig moves. I hear them
plainly but the words are drowned out by the thrill of the hunt.

A movement in the leaves behind the log they’re hiding behind and one
peeks up. Like a shot I darted out of the bush I was hiding behind and
without even touching the ground I hit him broadside and hurled
ourselves silently into the brush east of them. The force of the impact
had broken nearly every bone in his body. I immediately went for the
kill while I listened intently to the remaining raiders behind that log.

“Where did Jim go? I was just talking to him. I swear by Christ I was
looking right at him and he up and vanished like a fart in the wind..”

A second man said, “The hell? What manner of sorcery is this? We have to
get in and get the slaughter finished.”

The first man said, “Don’t forget to save two or three for the slavers
we should be able to herd that many with us. The black court of vampires
were looking for human components and hides for their own rituals we
should check to see if there are any of these humans that could be
harvested. It fetches a high price Tom, you know it’s worth it even if
it is disgusting.”

Holy Jesus fucking Christ they would do that to their own species? Oh my
God these particular humans are all food, I’m taking them all down.
First I need to keep them away from the camp. I stealthily drag the
corpse south of where they are entrenched and separate the parts with
surgical cuts from my talons and some tearing.

one of the men entrenched north of me said, “What is that sound? It
sounds like someone’s eating chicken, tearing off the legs and stuff.”

Another one said, “Dude, that ain’t no chicken.”

At that I hurled the head still attached to the spine right behind that
log. They were screaming like little girls. As they ran north to escape
I took to the trees and easily caught up to them. I reached the lead man
and with my talons truncated his torso from his legs and hurled his legs
into the raider immediately behind. I had a pretty good idea what was
coming next. I took the torso to the trees, an old thick tree that
looked like it would stand up to an rpg easily.

The raider shreaked, shouts of terror came from below and they opened
fire in every direction. Clip after clip, m249, m16, ak47 handguns rpgs
everything was getting emptied into empty air. When it stopped it looked
like a forest fire had torn through. Smoke was everywhere and the trees
were little more than jagged torn trunks to both sides of the raiders
below. Only the oldest still stood, which included mine. They never shot
into the trees, they never thought of it. They were too terrified to
think of it.

In the meantime I fed. There wasn’t much blood left in this cadaver and
no life left in the blood that was left. It was disgusting I stopped
drinking. I just don’t seem to get anything from humans that arent still
alive. I tried sucking the marrow from his bones and never was there a
sweeter food. It was like the icing on the cake. I will need to remember
that. The rest of the cadaver is like the rind of an orange or the shell
of a peanut I don’t like the taste of flesh and I refuse to eat it.

One said, “We got him. We had to have gotten him. Nothing could survive
that.”

Another said, “Ok, moving south. Let’s get what we came here for and get
the hell out of this place.”

I move in to the south sliding down a large tree, purring like a great
cat. Just loud enough to hear.

One said, “Dude what’s that sound?”

Another said, “Just a monkey or something, forget it, keep moving.”

“You’re a fool, if a monkey survived the onslaught we just laid out for
it pray mercy I never have occasion to see that monkey. Especially not
one that purrs like a great cat.”

I lash some vines to the torso and suspending him upside down I skin the
cadaver and strip it’s organs. I weave together a jute like bag from the
undergrowth to create a kind of fetish and lay the organs inside. After
I move into the trees some distance away.

I hear a scream, a cry, and vomiting. I peer in their direction to see
them circling around themselves back to back. each of them were checking
their weapons one by one, reloading as necessary.

“Tom, what do we do? My God man what do we do? The devil himself has
come to harvest our soul. I swear it’s true. What else can survive the
destruction we’ve dished out? He’s come for payment he has, come to take
us back to hell with him.”

“Shutup idiot. There ain’t no devil this is just some earthbound
creature. If we can catch it we can kill it.”

I see them moving together tightly packed. If I determined some earthly
creature was the enemy I would do the same. They are getting too close
to Jobu I need to get back to him to figure out a way to get him out and
in a safe place.

One of the raiders said, “Tom, you and I both know it ain’t no monkey.
No earthbound creature. It ain’t the devil neither man. What sits in
between these two ideas hmm? What is the most sensible idea?”

Tom said, “A goddamn supernatural, of course. a vamp or demon. No a vamp
don’t sound like that, can’t survive what we dished out. Willy you’re
the warlock what is this?”

OOOOoooo shit! There’s a warlock with them! That is the one thing that
could be a worry to me. Jars and other supernatural ordinance can do me
in. Move you’re ass Susan get to Jobu if you take on a warlock you might
not live to help him.

I stop bothering to listen to them and focus on getting to Jobu. He’s in
bad shape.

“Are you able to move Jamar?”

“Not a chance Susan, I’m sorry. The shock is wearing off and I can’t
move even so much as a finger without crumpling up with pain. I’m done.
You’re hurt Susan, you’re covered in blood.”

“Not my blood.”

“All the screaming out there, they were utterly terrified. You’re
covered in their blood…”

Does he know? I hope not. If he thinks I’m a vamp then I’m an instant
enemy.

“…You’re one of our elite aren’t you? How are you so good without
infection? Man, you’re the real thing. A real elite soldier. Special
forces material.”

Just then the enemy soldiers yell, “Whatever you are, what manner of
supernatural creature know now that we have supernatural ordinance and
we’re rearmed. You won’t win. You are going to suffer for what you did
to our people.”

Fear washed over me. I’m in real danger of death or banishment now. They
don’t even know what I am yet they are breaking out the crafts of their
warlock. It’s their only hope if they come across a supernatural
adversary. When I was fellowship we would wait to see the whites of
their eyes before we rearmed with supernatural ammo, or antivamp,
whatever you want to call it. I have them really scared.

“Susan their coming this way. Leave me, get to safety.”

“I do not leave a fellow soldier.”

“I saw the fear in your eye just then, you aren’t exactly human are
you?”

“… Well… not exactly no.”

“Then what… are you?”

“I don’t know Jamar, I’m learning more everyday. I have red court
characteristics but—”

I extend my talons

“There are other things about me that aren’t the same.”

“So you weren’t in any real danger before, were you now?”

“I’ve been jarred before Jamar.”

“You are in danger now, grave danger. Why won’t you run now? Why are you
fighting for us, what are we to you and you’re species?”

“I am a fellowship soldier Jamar, same as before. I won’t leave a man
down. I won’t turn my back on my mission. Sarg sent me to do a job and
I’ll see it done or die trying. It is a point of honour and by honour I
abide.”

I felt a pressure in my back for a moment. I felt like I grew a foot
taller, maybe five. I think I’m learning what it may take to transform
to that dark angel true form. It’s not a matter of trying but of being.
I have to be the person that it represents. First piece of the puzzle is
honour.

A bullet hit me in the side and I screeched. Deathstone ammunition.
Mordite. A stream of disintegration followed the trajectory. It’s
outsider technology harnessed by warlock spells. It is, anti-matter. The
bullet missed anything vital but that wound is not going to heal any way
but naturally and slowly.

Jamar said, “Christ, Get out now Susan! Run!”

I said, “I have a duty Jamar, stay low. If I die out there it won’t be
as a coward. The fellowship is and always will be my family and there
are innocents here that we protect. Now stay low, let me do my duty.”

I run toward them moving to the west side. Jamar said, “No! Susan get
out it’s suicide!” I make a rustle here and there as I go to draw fire
away from Jamar. Disintegration followed me as the deathstone bullets
flew. I dove and rolled through the ditch I was in some time ago. I
overtook one who laid wait in the ditch and pierced his ribcage with my
talons hard enough to exit the other side. He couldn’t scream I was on
him and drank him dry. Screw the games I left him to lie. I grabbed his
deathstone grenade launcher and moved north. Leaping out of the ditch
they opened fire. They must have expended some personal enhancement
technologies. Technomage, not a warlock. They have a frickin technomage!
They are able to bind mystical spells and items to modern technology.
Weapons especially. They have the covetted ability to merge outsider
materials to modern weapons. I thought they just had one shot and jars.
I was wrong. The forest behind me disintegrated from an explosion of
gas, automatic fire and grenades, and became the landscape of mars.

I fired my launcher back at the raiders and saw a purple flash. A wave
of cold lashed back at me freezing the trees and vegitation around me.
Looking there appeared a lifeless pocket of twenty by twenty martian
landscape. Two of the raiders didn’t have much left and three were left
there with a muddy appearance but otherwise untouched. Counter mordite
technology. Their buddies didn’t have it and weren’t so lucky, they
disintegrated from the round explosion; they just simply ceased to
exist. I feel bad for the devil, he won’t be gathering their souls. It
is the most dangerous substance in our universe, in all creation or
should I say outside of creation, because it comes from the chaos beyond
our universe. The “outside,” the outer chaos.

I throw a rock to hit one and it disintegrates. It must be attuned to
them somehow, it is acting like mordite in protecting them. I need a
warlock to counter this. I’m grabbing Jamar and running, I hope I don’t
hurt him too bad doing that.

Jamar had some bouncing betties, I’m not sure if it will help but I
plant them then run. I’m trying hard not to hurt him so it is going to
take a few minutes to get south. We heard a mine blow but I was pretty
sure that wouldn’t do much against mordite technology. Sure enough a few
minutes later I heard another blast as they hit another mine. We are
getting fairly distant now and my friends should now be up with the
sargeant.

When we got up to the Sargeant to find his battle was successful. He
blew the APC with a recoilless rifle and it looks like he took down a
dozen soldiers as they came in from the open area around the road.
Nobody was injured and here we come limping in like we were coming from
Io Jima.

“Sarg shit is coming from the south, got them outsider tech down there,”
I said.

“Jesus christ Susan these people didn’t, why would they?”

Bones said, “Yeah they did Sarg, this one has a ton in his ruck.”

Jamar said, “Same here Sarg. They just would waste deployment on a
conventional enemy. Mostly jars here it wouldn’t work on humans anyway.”

Sarg said, “bloody hell, we gotta get outta here fast..”

I said, “I can hold them off Sarg, I might not be able to finish them
but I can at least slow them down—”

Sarg said, “Absolutely not. We’re a team, we all live or we all die.”

Laura said, “Get me to that APC. I’ll get it running and we’ll be gone.”

Sarg said, “Nobody could get that thing going I plugged it with a Carl
G.”

Laura said, “I ain’t just nobody, trust me, it will run. I’ll make it
run.”

“Are you willing to bet your life on it; to bet all our lives on it?”

“I would Sargeant, damn right I would.”

“Well we don’t have a hell of a lot of choice here. I haven’t known you
long Laura but either we go or we die. How are we getting there without
getting killed in the open?”

Edgar the warlock said, “I’ll lay down a spread of decoys Sarg, it will
redirect them away from us as we run.”

Sarg said, “Do it now. Everyone grab what you need quickly. We can go
encumbered, grab only what you need and we run fast. Spook do your work
I’ll pack shit for you to grab as you’re running.”

All of us are scampering doing what needs to be done as if we were mice
being chased by cats. Spook was chanting burning and dancing, quickly
burning embers scattering into the forest. A terrible cold surrounded
him, black magic, what is he doing? Personally I don’t see any decoys
but if he says so I’ll go along with it. Why black magic for decoys?
Stop thinking Susan move faster.

Sarg said, “Spook, do we need to go? I don’t want to leave you it’s
suicidal for any of us to stay.”

Spook told Sarg to hold five, then he said, “right, all is set Sarg
let’s move.”

Sarg said, “You heard the Spook, everyone move full speed to the APC,
gather to the far side 20 meters north where there is a drainage ditch.
We stay there, if there is inbound fire we’ll take it away from the APC
if we can. Laura we will try to draw fire from you but God help you.”

Laura said, “God be damned, I’ll get it done.”

Collateral Damage
=================

e heard screams from the wood. Spook is acting really odd, he seems,
narcissistic somehow. I looked into the wood and saw a horror show. They
are laughing; they are laughing and tearing into each other; they are
disintegrating each other; they are laughing and eating each other; they
are enjoyed the taste of each others flesh; they relished the sensation
of being consumed by each other; they tore each other apart piece by
piece, organ by organ, flesh for flesh, disembowelling, consuming blood
and drowning in absolute ecstacy from it all. Death came slow to them
and yet they embraced death like a long lost love. That’s what the cold
was, Spook wasn’t casting a distraction he cast some kind of very dark
spell.

It took about an hour, far longer than Laura thought but the raiders
were cannibalizing each other. They paid no interest in us. The forest
became more and more quiet as they died. Spook’s eyes became more and
more empty as the effect of the black magic he cast took hold. The
fellowship warlocks that were infected could cast black magic with
impunity but now that they are human every use of black magic causes
ever greater corruption and insanity. Human spellcasters have been this
way and the white court of wizards have known this. They have wardens
whose duty it is to decapitate anyone who even so much as makes a single
act of black magic. We were overlooked simply because we were their
allies in the war against red court vampires. What about now though?

I make my way to Spook. He doesn’t make any sense, he is maniacal and
quite psychotic. It isn’t him who is speaking now, he is trapped inside
himself.

I said to Sarg, “Have you noticed Spook isn’t quite right?”

Sarg said, “I’ve noticed. I don’t know what to think except he needs
some sleep. It’s been a hell of a haul for all of us.” Then he spoke out
to everyone to board the APC. I took spook aside for a brief feeding in
order to try to make a psychic bond with him.

I said telepathically to me people, *“Is everyone OK? We haven’t had
long to talk.”*

Jill said, *I’m OK. Tired as hell. I’ll be glad to get south to safety
and rest.”*

The others, in turn, said essentially the same. They hadn’t felt any
connections to the kills I made. I guess it takes consistency. Maybe it
takes willingness.

I’m scared for spook. He might get lost inside himself and never come
back. I’m his only hope. If I can’t come through for him whether it’s
the wardens or not we are going to need to take off his head. There is
no other way for his own safety and those of others who might be harmed
or killed by him in his insanity.

I moved in towards Jill to talk a while. I said, “I’m sorry Jill I
failed you guys. I tried so hard. I had them scared it should have been
so easy to take them down. Jamar got hurt and I don’t know if Spook will
ever be the same. He is falling to the corruption of black magic and I
don’t know if I can save him”

“Susan you didn’t know they had paranormal ordinance. How could you?
There’s nothing you could have done. What happened to Spook would have
happened eventually. But it happened now. And you’re here. Guess what? I
didn’t feel the connection to the other enemies but Susan I felt spook.
Just a little. I think what you believe is a failure may be hope for
Spook. Maybe you can heal him, maybe even galvanize him from the
corruption like he was during infection. You’re here now. What if he
fell sick from his magic later when you weren’t here? I believe in you
Susan, you can save him.”

“It doesn’t make it right Jill there must have been something more I
could have done, you guys took down a dozen of the bastards I couldn’t
take down half a dozen, and I’m easily ten times the strength and speed
of any man.”

“Yeah but you’re not counting the women.”

I laughed and said, “OK. OK girl. I hear ya.”

“It’s not about the speed, or the strength Susan. Gotta outsmart them.”

“They brought out paranormal ordinance, if I tried to drive them off
rather than kill them it might not have happened. Spook might have been
OK. He’s falling into dark magic corruption trying to save us. It’s my
fault. I caused it.”

“Bullshit. Get a hold of yourself Susan. Sarg send Jamar south to guard
us and he was wounded all the same. Jamar didn’t know enemies were
coming from the south. He didn’t want to get injured anymore than you
wanted them to pull out the mordite and come at us. I’ve lost people in
my life too Susan, I could blame myself and get stuck in woulda, coulda,
shoulda but that doesn’t help anybody. You faced mordite for us Susan,
you faced death for our sake. You didn’t run away or avoid the danger.
To show such courage what more could anyone ask of you? Hindsight is
twenty twenty and we learn by our mistakes. You didn’t fail us you stood
and fought through it all.”

Something took a hold on me. It was like I saw Jill as who she really
was for the first time. It wasnt about telepathy, it was deeper than
that. She is just such a beautiful soul. She accepts me for who I am;
she accepts me for what I am. She’s there for me in everything, feeding
me, consoling me. I raised my hands to her cheeks and smiled. Then I
kissed her; it was a real kiss, a passionate kiss. I took her into my
arms and held her tight; held her like there was no tomorrow. I kissed
her again and released her, then held her hands intimately. I released
no venom, the feelings I was developing displaced my hunger. She was
becoming to me something far different than a thrall, and it left me
confused.

She said, “Um, Susan I really don’t swing that way. You’re my vampire
and all and I show you great love but I can’t be your mate. At the
moment I wish I could but I don’t see how.”

I laughed and said, “Where have I heard that before? I guess the tables
have turned hmm?”

She was confused a moment then laughed. Then she said, “of course, when
we first met I tried to draw you close and tempt you by spooning you.
You told me then you don’t swing that way. If that’s right why make a
move on me?”

“It’s about the feelings I’ve come to have for you. Maybe it’s not love;
maybe it’s not a crush. Maybe it’s a squish. Whatever it is I want to
follow how I feel.”

“Well let me think about it. We’ll talk at a later time about it. I’m
just not ready yet, I’m confused. Let me be your thrall at least for
now. I need the healing properties of your venom Susan and if changing
our relationship takes that away then we can’t. When you made you’re
move, God help me, you didn’t release venom. Need I say that scares the
hell out of me.”

I felt so embarrased. I said to Jill, “I understand. I don’t think my
feelings will change but I’ll let you have as much time as you need.”

She said, “Thanks. For what it’s worth I love you too. Don’t feel
embarrased. I just need to search my feelings to know what it means to
me; I need to understand the consequences of any decision I make.”

She was absolutely right. I made mistakes but I acted with a lionheart.
I didn’t hide or run away I moved in and did what I felt was right. We
had to flee, but facing mordite weapons there was nothing else anyone
could have done. The gods themselves would flee mordite.

We did OK. Jamar is injured but alive. We are all alive. Spook isn’t
well, his spirit is corrupted. I need to bring him healing somehow. We
had to leave behind a lot of our gear when we fled. We now have an APC
though.

We aren’t going to be able to stay out here very long without our
rations. We have some on our person but we need to find somewhere to
reprovision very soon. This APC has got to keep running, to get us south
before we starve. What if our main camp has fallen? What if our people
had to relocate? Oh God I hope not, I don’t know what we would do.

Right now I think the most important thing for me to do would be to help
Jamar, I can talk to Bones to see what I can do. Spook needs me, Bones
can’t help him. Noone but me can help him and even then I can’t be sure
I will be able to rescue him from the darkness that is consuming him. I
will try and convince Sarg to let Spook stay with me and my thralls so I
can feed my way to a deeper connection with him.

I’ll talk to Sarg tonight to take Spook in with my people. The
fellowship soldiers have enough to worry about tactically without
worrying about spook so it shouldn’t be a problem. I think he is in the
most need right now Bones can work with Jamar but it is far beyond his
ability to treat Spook in any way.

It’s up to me, I’m the only one with supernatural ability and the only
one then that can cure a supernatural ailment. I know my venom and bite
can heal, I need to heal him. I need to find a way to spin this to
prevent the soldiers from suspecting me of being anything but human for
my own safety and maybe even the safety of my thralls. They wouldn’t
know if they are infected and with their loyalty to me the odds are they
will be executed along with me as traitors to the human species.

I go to Sarg, “I want to take spook into camp with us Sarg, with our
people. We have always camped alone together with out own gear and we
still need that privacy at night. You have enough tactically to deal
with and Spook is a burden to your people in his current state. We can
take care of him.”

“Granted. You all can take him but we are going to have to take his head
soon, he is going to be a danger to himself and us too. I have a lot
greater tolerance than the white council regarding the corruption of
black magic but then again warlocks can be life and death for us out
here.”

“I think the fellowship as a whole feels that way. Personally I am even
more tolerant than before since most of our warlocks don’t have the
protection offered by the infection.”

“Yeah. I don’t know what we are going to do. Assuming the fellowship is
going to continue even accepting the warlock refugees from other places
in the world may just invite greater danger for the fellowship and
others.”

“There are a lot of decisions to be made in the near future. I guess we
just continue one day at a time.”

“Yeah. One day at a time. Damn right.”

So I talked to Bones about Jobu.

I said, “Do you need any help Bones? I’m mostly involved with my own
people and we don’t have the same military responsibility as you and the
other fellowship people.”

“I’m good looking after him at night. We all need sleep though so if you
want to have one of your people watch over him so everyone can get
better sleep. As it is having the one sentry rotation at night works out
well and I would like us all to stick with that.”

“OK, one of us will rotate at night to watch him. How is he anyway?”

“One of his wounds has become infected. Badly infected. He isn’t in
immediate danger right now but he could get a lot worse very soon. I
have him on antibiotics and I’m hoping it will work to cure the
infection soon.”

“A personal question, do you have any experience in psychology at all?”

“I was in doctors without borders when I got infected, took remedial
training to support the people out here. So yeah. You got issues? Need
to seek help?”

“Yeah doc a labotomy and a straightjacket oughtta do me. It’s like a.
Err… Kaffkaff, sex thing…”

“OooOOOoo, having female issues?”

“Not exactly no.”

I go on to explain what is happening with me and my feelings for Jill
and how I like guys and not girls so I’m confused.

“Jill you’re just bi-romantic that’s all.”

“I am not gay doc I already told you—”

“No no not bi-sexual, bi-romantic.”

“That’s a thing?”

“Yes that’s a thing. Maybe it’s the changes in your life since your
infection was cured or maybe the current war or the possibility of
resuming your pre-infected life. I think something triggered it to
surface. It may be fluidity and your romantic orientation changed.
Regardless romantic orientation is who you get feelings for, seek
companionship and intimacy with and maybe even fall in love with. Just
not necessarily having sexual attraction for. It’s just how we’re
wired.”

“Oh I get it. It doesn’t make things any easier, it might even make
things harder, but it helps knowing.”

“Anytime Susan.”

That night I took a feeding from Spook to try to heal him like I heal my
thralls. Then we all went to sleep for the night. As I slept I had a
vision of Spook. I seen a creature like an octopus attacking him in the
darkness. I could see his psyche batting off tentacles. Every once in a
while one would pierce his body and he would scream and pull it out.
Sometimes another would pierce him while he struggled with the first.
Then sometimes he couldn’t get to one in time and it sank it’s barbed
tentacle deep inside him and he was powerless to pull it out. Slowly one
after another pierced him deeply and the octopus drew in closer
slithering the tentacles in deeper and deeper. Parts of his psyche were
killed little by little by the tentacles invading his mind. The
tentacles then slowly took over his mind creating anger, jealousy, mania
and senseless behaviour. He can’t control the parts of him that are dead
or dying, under the control of the monster. I drew myself closer and the
octopus creature, being somewhat humanoid in appearance, bowed and began
to back away and leave him. It meant the creature was tearing out the
barbed tentacles. Spook was shrieking at the top of his lungs as his
psyche was being ripped apart. At that moment I awoke shaking. Jill and
the other thralls were also shaking as well as vomiting from the vision
we shared telepathically. We ran to look at Spook and his eyes were
glassy; his mouth was foaming. His hands were clawing at his chest and
tore open the skin. We heard him moan in an empty zombie like way. He
bit a piece of flesh off his arm and we leapt at him and restrained him
with a rope. He was chewing peacefully on the chunk of flesh he tore off
himself. We held a piece of gauze to his arm to stop the bleeding and
Craig ran to wake Bones to patch him up.

“Susan we can’t leave him to suffer any more. He has gotten far worse
tonight and it’s clear he is a danger to himself now. I’m going to talk
to Sarg in the morning and recommend to him that the time has come to
take his head. It was commendable of you to try helping him but there is
no cure for the madness that comes from the practise of black magic.”

“I just need more time Bones, we can help him. I only just started to
reach him tonight, please don’t do this.”

“I’m sorry Susan but my medical opinion stands. He’s gone, we need to
execute him before he causes harm.”

I need to do something to save him, Bones isn’t going to give Spook a
chance to recover, no chance for me to heal him. I need to do something
to stop this. I know Sarg won’t have a choice but to order the execution
now that Spook is harming himself.

I nibbled on Spook for those last few hours before sunrise, trying with
faint hope to bring him back before we break camp. The soldiers are
camped outside under one man tents we found in the APC. Me, Spook, and
the thralls are inside. Once we are underway there is no way I can
nibble on Spook without getting caught. Oh please Spook get better.
Please get better before it’s too late.

That night at the campfire the fellowship team carried along a solar
radio. “Who wants to live forever” started playing and Injun took out a
harmonica and played along to the tune. It really effected me. I will
live forever. I will see people be born; I will see people die; I will
see the cycle then start anew. I will see empires rise; then I will see
them fall, rulers will rise and then they will be thrown down again and
again throughout my existence. I will not know a friend who I will not
lose; I will not know a lover who will not be torn from my arms. Even
the very earth itself will change before my eyes, seas will rise and
mountains will fall. Yet still will I be here; yet still will I walk
this accursed realm. Long will I long for a good death, to see my
parents who bore me and the friends and family long passed before but
such mercy will never come. Never will I know peace; never will I find
real belonging in the world again; there will only be that damnable
cycle of feeding; there will be that damnable curse, neverending. Is
this all for having killed Martin? So many men have killed other men and
yet death comes to the good and the evil why not me? Oh why not me.

Who wants to live forever. Not me. My head hung low and tears started to
run down my cheeks. I press my eyes closed and shake my head. I can feel
the familiar ecstasy, the manic release as the flesh mask falls from my
fingers and my talons begin to emerge appearing retracted and like the
claws of a red court vampire. I look down to them as my tears flowed,
flexed them and looked on the physical proof of my nightmare; the
physical proof of my deathless state.

A revelation of this proportion is difficult but I need to keep this
from becoming a deadly revelation. I need to control myself, the last
thing I need is for a greater change to come over me now.

I started to come back to reality and realized I just revealed myself.
Everyone knows I’m a vampire now. I should be afraid; I should run but I
don’t care. I just don’t care anymore. Let them take my head. The
fellowship would kill it’s own when they turned and only jar them as a
final resort. It is the only mercy we would allow for our fellow
soldiers who fully turned. The mercy of being destroyed.

I slowly looked up. My thralls were looking at the fellowship soldiers
with eyes wide enough they risked falling out. Jill began stroking her
fang necklace and wringing her hands. Jamar looked over at Sarg quickly
and spoke in a soft voice, “Sarg, no worries ok, she’s been righteous.
She ain’t got no claws on her but talons she ain’t no red Sarg. She
ain’t no red—” Sarg said, “The hell she isn’t. I know a red when I see
one and she’s been deceiving us this whole time. The reds ain’t dead
this has been their plan all along. They went somewhere and this one got
left out to die, and die she will. We need to find their strategy in
this Jamar, she obviously took out our warlock because he is the only
one who is any threat to her. Bones, check the supernatural ordinance.
Are our jars accounted for?”

Bones checked and said, “Aye Sarg, everything is fully accounted for.”

Jamar grabbed Sarg with both hands and lightly shook him, then said,
“Don’t you see Sarg? She ain’t the enemy here. Something happened to her
but she didn’t turn red. She’s something else and she ain’t corrupted.
She saved my life man and risked her own against the raiders despite
supernatural ordinance. She’s righteous man don’t ask it!”

Sarg said, “Injun, get the katana. Jamar you son of a bitch you’re gonna
cut her down else I’ll take you as enthralled and cut you down as well.”

I remained still while they argued, then assumed a kneeling position
slowly in front of Sarg. I intended to show him the obedience he
deserves as a sargeant of the fellowship and place myself willingly
before the blade. Besides I do still wish this to be over. I don’t wish
to be incarcerated on this earth indefinately, I want to go to the sleep
of death and rise to my heavenly destination where I could meet the
family I never knew and the soldiers that had fought and fallen by my
side. I grieve for them all so much; their death has caused wounds on me
that have never healed, nor will they ever fully heal.

“Sarg, look. She kneels before the blade. Still she’s righteous to her
vows, she’s one of us Sarg she’s…uncorrupted.” said Jamar.

“It’s a trick! Injun check the perimeter, Jamar back up and cover her
with your rifle; ready a jar in case you need it. Bones cover Injun when
we find the bastards you and me are gonna open up on them. Ready the
jars.”

Bones put a hand on his forehead and dipped his head slightly. Bones
said, “Jesus Christ, Sarg this is ludicrous, think about what you are
doing. The way of our life is one of paranoia but we both know
fellowship divided will fall. She hasn’t in any way shown herself to be
corrupted. This is madness, there is no contingent in this bush.”

Sarg said, “You’re the one that is mad, the only good red is a dead
red.”

“Perimeter is clear Sarg.” said Injun.

“Bullshit, fine there is some other scheme. Well I won’t be swindled by
this bitch whatever is up she has a purpose here and that purpose ends
here and now. Proceed with the execution Jamar, time to end this.” said
Sarg.

Valley Of Death
===============

lang! I look up and Bones had swung his rifle in the path of the katana
as it came down, tears flowing in Jamar’s eyes.

Bones said, “Goddammit Sarg, I hearby relieve you of duty Sargeant
Dwight Miller on cause of madness. Jamar you will take leadership of
this team until I deem Sargeant Miller to be fit for duty again.”

Sarg said, “You have got to be kidding, don’t fucking joke Bones I ain’t
in the mood and there’s an enemy among us. Jamar get it done.”

Jamar said, “No Sarg, he is our medic and he has the authority. You are
acting mad right now and you need to get your squirrels out.”

Sarg said, “What a goddamn clusterfuck, you people have a goddamned
screw loose she must have poisoned the rations, or you all got
enthralled! Bloody hell that’s it you all are going down.” He pulled
forward his rifle and clicked off the safety, “for the fellowship, for
justice!”

I didn’t know if I could do it but I know the reds could hypnotize by
looking into a humans eyes, control them from afar. I quickly raised my
eyes to meet Sarg. Instinctively reacting to my intent the black vampire
eyes unveiled themselves as my third eyelid covered over my eyes and I
could see the world again as no human could. The vitality of my human
companions was evident, the health of their bodies and the vision of
their blood flowing through them. Their psychic aura presented itself
revealing more about them than they knew about themselves if I chose to
observe them intently but there was no time and no reason for doing it.
My eyes drilled into Sarg’s and I pierced his psyche; I pierced that
burning red aura that revealed without doubt the sheer anger he was
feeling; I pierced the madness that had surrounded him and consumed him.
His thoughts lay before me at my mercy, to be twisted by my will but
this I refuse to do. I raised my hand and blew a cool breeze from my
lips as if I was blowing a kiss and moulded it into a psychic wind that
washed over Sarg extinguishing the fire and madness that was consuming
him. I could see him fall limp but his fire once again began to grow.
Bones grabbed his rifle and threw it while Jamar covered him with his
own rifle.

I’m trying to fall back into a fully human form but it’s not happening.
I never did anything like that before and I have no experience that
would allow me to know how to return. I see the ice surrounding Sarg,
the cone of ice formed on the ground from me to him like some kind of
telltale sign that neuromantic power was just unleashed. It’s
inevitable, I’m trying to hold back the ocean as I continue my change
into another form. I’m clenching my jaw, I’m holding on for now but not
much longer.

Bones said, “I swore to you that I would keep your confidence Sarg but I
will not do so in the face of murder. You have never resolved your pain
from the loss of your wife we both know that and I do believe we both
knew it would someday cause you to make mistakes. I hoped that it would
not cause too much trouble or put anyone in danger but this lunacy is
far and above what I thought. I take the blame for that you should never
have had a position of power in this fellowship. I pray to God above may
he have mercy on my soul for making such a grievous error as this. Now
you look at that woman and look real close, who do you see? Who do you
see in her you fool?”

Sarg looked at me, wrung his hands and rolled his head. He held his hand
to his chin and then I seen his eyes start to grow. His face grew white.
He started to shake and turned to the side to vomit into a bush. Sarg
said, “My God, Jennifer! She looks exactly like Jennifer!”

Bones said, “That’s right fool. Your wife. You’re trying to bring peace
to your wife. Is this your wife Sarg? If it is I weep for you man but I
do believe she said her name was Susan did she not?”

Sarg said, “She isn’t Jennifer. She looks like her but I knew Jennifer,
her likes, her dislikes, the way she could make me laugh and inspire me
every day. My love knew her and still knows her and no this is not
Jennifer; this is not my beloved Jennifer.” Sarg was on his knees now
facing me, with his head hung low to the ground he wept.

Bones let out a long whistle and shook his head as he turned towards me.
Jamar in his new command declared, “I’ll watch him doc, take a look at
Susan she looks like shes trying to shit a brick.”

I was clenching my teeth and now I’m clenching my whole face. I’m
feeling dizzy from the effort and sweat is pouring off me. I have
tightly clenched fists; my body is trembling. Jamar gave a very fair
description. I’m desperately holding off the change.

Bones looked at me and said, “What is it about today, ain’t no full moon
that I know. Oh Sarg, goddamit man, what did you do to this poor woman
in your mad display. Susan what is going on with you?”

I looked at Bones and said, “The effort I put in helping Sarg, I
triggered something. I’m undergoing some sort of change. I’ve been
holding on the best I can; I can’t do it forever. I’m scared Bones. I
can’t know what this change will be and it scares me.”

Bones looked to Jamar who was close enough to hear me out. Bones said to
Jamar, “OK call it boss.”

Jamar said, “Right. Bones and Injun take position twenty feet
equidistant from Susan. Sarg, we’ll cover the civilians.”

Jack said, “Damn straight. ’bout time you took notice of us over here.
We’ll grab rifles as well to support you guys.”

Bones said, “Good. Cry ’Havoc,’ and let slip the hounds of hell, Susan
let yourself go.”

![image](Images/hrule.png)

I let go. There was nothing for a moment then I felt a trembling from
deep within me. Then like a distant explosion the fire and mania poured
through me and seemingly out of every pore. It pulled me into the air; I
hovered; my wings broke free from my back and my clothes tore and fell
to the ground. I grew to a height of ten feet tall; my body flowed into
supermodel proportions; my hair fell out in wild abandon and my legs
transformed to a digitigrade stance, with my talons extended. My calves
grew sleek, sexy and furry. My foot talons then folded to form hooves.
My body was firm and gorgeous like the greek goddess Aphrodite. The men
surrounding me left a lake of drool fit to fish in. I stretched my wings
slightly. Flap-flap, flap…flap. I descended to the ground landing on my
pseudo-hooves. The sheer power of my awareness was overwhelming. I
lowered myself down to one knee and covered my head in my arms to try to
block out stimuli. It was too much for me to process and it took a few
moments for me to block it all out. I looked up again, now holding back
the torrent of sensations; I am in fear of cracks appearing in that dam
I erected; I rest precariously on nothing but my own strength to keep me
sane.

Sarg was getting his senses back slowly, enough to say, “That ain’t no
red. She be a greek god maybe or some fallen angel but she ain’t be no
red by God.”

I slowly looked myself over. I grabbed a mirror and seen myself dark
with midnight hair flowing like in a breeze yet on this day when the air
is still. I’ve never seen anything like this. I look out over my friends
to behold a sea of thousand mile stares, their psyches overwhelmed. I
see Spook, but not in this physical world. My eyes perceive an infinity
of realities, all time, all places, all things and spirits are within my
knowing and all these and more I block out but I see him in a place that
is not of this physical plane. Oh yes his body is here but I see that he
has been stolen from us and imprisoned in a dark horror of his own
creation. Yet in my being, as I am, I know this place to be in my reach;
and it is mine to travel; it is my duty to seek him and to find him; it
is my duty to bring him home.

I am burdened by miraculous purpose and focus on Spook. I lift myself up
on these wings of glory and follow a mysterious path. I flew not in any
of the directions of a compass, nor up or down. Into a foreign and
twisted reality I flew and the world faded like a thick cloud coming
over the sun; it faded like those same clouds passing into twilight; it
faded from twilight to night, then from night to the darkness of a
cavern in the midst of the earth. Yet once consumed by this new reality
I find it is vast, truly endless. My eyes adjust and all I can see here
is shades of grey. It appears as if everything here was once alive but
has long since become dead. Not even decay has survived as everything
has become simply dust, time has had no power to consume that which has
been and death has become immortal in all that I see. The burden on my
heart is profound, the pain of the descent of oblivion has settled on
me. I am raging against the psychological effect of this corrupt and
dark environment assaulted by guilt, horror, terror, hopelessness. This
place seems to attack me, it wishes to assimilate me into this horrible
death that I see before me. I must reach Spook, and quickly, my new form
and the burden of this place will soon be too much. I cannot let myself
be consumed.

I began walking to where I knew Spook was. I don’t know how it is that I
knew, I just knew where he will be. Leafless trees and grass still in
it’s perfect shape but falling to dust as I walk on it with with my
hooves. After about a mile I noticed the fur on my calves and some of my
skin was turning black. The damned dust is necrotizing my flesh. I leap
far into the air and thrust out my wings. I’m going to try to fly there.
I’m going to exhaust myself before I get anywhere near Spook. I try
extending my wings out as far as I can. I find I can lay out a wingspan
of fifty feet and glide like an eagle. Perhaps I will get there ok after
all. The landscape below passes quickly but not quickly enough Spook is
far away indeed. Far beyond the horizon.

After a few hours I’m exhausted. Flapping or not I cant go on like this.
even if I was driving a car I would have to stop from time to time but
the ground is toxic I can’t stop. yet neither can I keep going.

I must have fallen asleep, or passed out, either way I skimmed the top
of a gnarly tree and tried to pull up. I hadn’t the strength to. As I
neared the ground I pushed up hard with my legs but it was no use. I
tumbled to the deadly ground and lay in a pile thoroughly exhausted.

I can’t afford to lose track of what I’m doing. I need to stay focused
and I can’t make any more mistakes. I shouldn’t have changed, in part or
in whole. I drove Sarg to madness and I don’t know if he’s OK. If he
isn’t I don’t know if anyone can bring him back. I don’t know if I can
bring spook back. I don’t know anything about what I am or what I can
do. It seems rather evident to me I’m not going to get to Spook and it’s
not even likely that I’ll live through the attempt to rescue him. I’m an
idiot. Why did I plunge into this realm not knowing whether I could do
this? All full of valour but without any common sense. So what now
Susan? Lay down and die like a fool it seems I can’t see any way this
could come out any different.

Well, no, I don’t need to be a coward either. I’ll get my rest then at
least I can walk for a while, flesh eating dust be damned. I know where
Spook is, I kind of know where I came from. Kind of. At least that’s
something. What’s my chances? ten out of ninety? five out of ninety
five? Pretty much guaranteed death. Well I don’t know where I’ll die out
here, so there isn’t any reason for being late in getting there.

I pull myself up, and walk around slowly to get the circulation back in
my limbs. The necrotization hasn’t spread any farther, so I’m lucky for
that. I start limping toward Spook.

Well OK, so I can’t fly there but maybe I can travel a little by foor
and then by wing. Maybe the necrotizing effect of this dust and soil
isn’t as bad as I presumed. Maybe. The trees are nothing but dust, touch
one and it crumbles into nothingness. No help there. Flat dusty surface
for as far as I can see in every direction and Spook is beyond the
horizon.

I tried moving slower, rolling my hooves over the ground to prevent
stirring the dust. It took some practise but I think I can do it. It’s
hard though that dust is very fine. Also I don’t know if my hooves are
immune to the necrotization effect. Only time and long travelling will
tell.

Flight gives my legs rest, for the next few miles I try alternating
flight and travel by foot and it helps. It’s sustainable.

That’s how I’m going to do this, flight and slow careful ground
movement. No need being in a hurry. Slow and steady and hope whatever
dust does settle on me has little or no effect on my body.

I decide to try flying at higher altitudes so I can glide farther with
less fatigue. It’s working. At least until I see something come towards
me from over the horizon. I flew too high, and now it seems something
has taken an interest in me.

I just need to approach this peacefully, I’m sure this entity has better
things to do than pick a fight. This should be over quick and I can
continue on my quest.

I continued on my way until it came closer. A dragon it seems like but
more serpent like, not the typical fantasy dragons. It seemed to be
swimming through the air like it was water, and was extremely agile. It
was truly massive and the agility it displays just seems to defy what
one would expect of such a large creature.

I said, “Hail spirit. I am Susan and I travel in peace. What might I do
for thee oh noble spirit?”

It said, “I have come to destroy you. I must in order that all that is
may be saved. Prepare yourself.”

I said, “How does that make sense? I said I travel in peace, you think I
deceive?”

It said, “Nay I trust in your word, your intentions are good. I have
come to destroy you for it must be done.”

I said, “Dude, you forget your meds this morning? Who wakes up and says
to themselves what a lovely day I should destroy Susan today?”

It said, “Don’t concern yourself with why, I must destroy you, it simply
must be done.”

I said, “What the actual fuck? You need serious help dude. Somebody
needs to put you in the spirit world psych ward because I’m pretty sure
you gotta be talking to lamps—”

I felt a sledgehammer hit one wing and it threw me into a spiral. I hit
the ground hard creating a huge cloud of dust. I stood up after a few
minutes and dusted myself off thoroughly.

I don’t know where it came from but I heard a booming voice say, “I am
the great Leviathan. You who are known as Susan will be destroyed by my
hand.”

Great. You make friends everywhere you go Susan. Especially anyone with
homicidal ideation. I threw my arms up in a profound shrug.

I said, “OK buddy, come get a little.”

![image](Images/hrule.png)

It was rather quick as it came down and nearly swallowed me alive but I
rolled to the side just in time only to have it’s tail slap me hard and
throw me thirty feet into the air. I was breathing so hard I felt like I
was going to pass out but managed to pull myself together and fought
hard to get my wings to move again. Oddly being slapped around like a
hockey puck does wonders for invigorating tired muscles.

Not even touching the ground after it’s strafing run it pulled up and
headed straight at me. I went into a dive and rolled in the air again
just missing that huge maw, one razor sharp tooth catching me in my side
then again the tail hit and threw me another 30 or 40 feet. It feels
like it’s holding back it’s strength but not it’s determination. Every
attack is more than strong enough to tear me to pieces.

It said, “You’re quite fast, I’m impressed. Yet I’m faster as you will
see.”

A snap of the tail and a crack, my shoulder is broken. The shock sent me
hurling to the ground. I managed to snap out of shock and flap my wings
once at the last minute slowing my descent but still hit hard.

I grit my teeth and punch the ground hard, pushing back my pain I take
to the skies again. Being airborne is my only chance against this thing.

This time when it came at me I flew toward the ground, speedily moving
out of the way of the giant maw. With lightning reflexes I pushed back
up and strafed the creatures torso with my talons as it’s momentum
pushed it by. I finally got a good hit in, it faltered in the air. It
fell into a dive but pulled back up with a fluid motion just before it
hit the ground. It pushed toward me with it’s talons ready to tear me
up. The creature banked to the right and I did a flip that would make
any pole jumper proud, right over it’s leg. I sunk a talon into the leg
as I came down the other side and spun raking it’s leg as I planted my
leg talons into it’s torso. Not to make the same mistake twice it
snapped itself around pushing it’s maw at me hoping to catch me like a
fly on pasteboard, talons sunk deep into it’s torso. I was quick enough
to use the leverage of those talons to throw myself fast and hard away
from the creature as it’s maw washed by missing me. Unfortunately it’s
tail came up hard on me and sent me into the sky like a home run in the
big leagues. I felt something snap on my chest and a sudden overwhelming
spike of pain. I was in a tailspin again hitting the ground with such
tremendous forward motion I felt like a commercial jet making a crash
landing in the Mojave. I was tumbling like a stone.

When my body came to rest I checked myself over I seemed to have broken
about every bone in my body. Broken bones were protruding from my wings,
one arm and one leg. I’m done for.

Leviathan came in for a final attack, I didn’t feel the hit, it was just
lights out, game over.

Identity Crisis
===============

hen I came to Leviathan was standing over me. I think every bone in my
body is broken, it took me five minutes of excruciating pain and an
unnatural power of will but I managed sit up and face him.

He said, “How can you still live? I intend to destroy you so that you
might manifest. If the whole is destroyed how could I ever make manifest
the one? Damn you Susan let go so that I can bring you forth.”

I said, “Jesus Christ would you make sense? You intended to kill me why
haven’t you killed me already? Take your meds man doctor knows best.”

He faced me directly and said, “[[ RENICH VIASA AVAGE SVZN LIRACH.

HH ML OE OL MRH. NOASMI NIIS GAHA OIAD NANAEEL OL NANAEEL MONASCI JADEN
TASA HOET NACA LIVYATAN. ]{}]{}”

Something awoke in me, and it wanted to emerge. I fought with all my
will to keep control but it was too strong, and I was too weak. The
world became surreal, and I became an observer of myself as some thing
took over my body. The lifeless realm around me shook to it’s
foundations. The necrotized parts of me healed over and I started to
mend. My wings extended and a diabolical sounding hiss came from my
lips. I feel a sense of omnipotence.

My lips said, “[[ IRGIL LEHA’EZ OL LE’ORER OLLOG LOAGAETH OL TENUMAH

I was far too weak to translate the language before but it is definitely
the same magical language from when I encountered Damian. The words that
passed my lips were, “How dare you rouse me from my slumber brother, Why
have you declared war upon me? Do you not know our conflict would bring
an end to all creation? I never thought you to be such the fool.” What
is going on?

Leviathan said, “I humbly beg your forgiveness sister, I suspect it was
your [[ enn ]{}]{} that summoned you. You did not hear the discourse
that I had spoken. I feared I could not subdue your earthly aspect and
call you forth oh great mother.”

So this entity, her name is great mother. Doesn’t help me understand but
I have a name and I remember Harry told me names are very powerful
things. I felt a change, the overpowering sense of omnipotence was
displaced by shock and excitement.

My lips said, “Are you shittin’ me? My mortal aspect manifested and
travelled the path of Osirus? Oh my fucking God, oh my God—”

That is something I would say. Big momma must have been sitting in my
psyche long enough to learn modern english. Yet she still makes no
sense.

Leviathan said, “—The prophecy has been fulfilled in my sight, dæmon,
God of Gods, substance of creation makes an earthly home for the first
time in the history of creation.”

My lips said, “I am extending my glory to her, I know she will grow
powerful and wise for she is me. Godspeed Susan, I know you hear me, go
get’em girl. I am returning to my peace now dear brother, now is Susan’s
time not mine. Thank you for what you have done here.”

Leviathan said, “Godspeed my sister.” Then he swam away and was gone.

![image](Images/hrule.png)

My head hurts. I think I have multiple personality disorder. Something
must have broke in me at . Is this all a dream? Is any of this real or
is it some kind of psychotic episode? They say an insane man is always
convinced of his sanity so I guess my doubts give credence to the
thought that I’m still sane. Yet look at me, and look at where I am. I
am on a mad quest to find a mad warlock in a mad mad world. Oh well if
even there’s a chance Spook is out there I need to keep on the quest.
Hell, it may be a quest I can’t complete but there ain’t no use
finishing late. I start walking forward, convinced that this realm isn’t
going to hurt me anymore.

Did I endure more mental trauma than I can handle in my transformation?
Is my time limited before I must be imprisoned or destroyed?

If I am now as supernatural as what I have seen, and whatever it I am
now, maybe there is something deeper.

I wrap my wings around myself and sit down, grooming them instinctively,
deep in thought.

Maybe there is another spirit in me. Maybe more than one. Maybe a good
Susan and a bad Susan; a mighty Susan and a lowly Susan; God help me
maybe there is a true red court vampire Susan as well as the unchanged
human spirit that I identify as being the true me.

I have a hearty laugh thinking of something I’ve heard before. Fuck it.
Alanis Morissette was right.

I say it’s best just to accept that I’m a complex being and move on. I
may make mistakes along the way yet I will also save lives like I’ve
done as well as beat the bad guys. I gotta give myself a break. Nice to
meet you, “Great Mother”

I tried to sleep, wrapping my wings around me like a feathery sleeping
bag but the deadly silence was unnerving and the cold penetrated through
my wings. After the troubled rest I started again by wing and by hoof to
rescue dear spook.

![image](Images/hrule.png)

I bore no hunger, no did I have any food to eat. Rest did not come, I
was weary from day to week to month. This place stole my hope; it stole
my laughter and my song; it stole every happy thought; it stole my
memories, replacing them with abominations of truth; it stole my inner
light, my sanity, my very soul. Evil has no place here, nor does good,
there is nothing. It is oblivion, nothing made manifest. Every moment I
fought dark thoughts that entered my mind; fought by logic; fought by
disbelief; fought by will and by anger.

Like a child who learns life on the street I learned survival and I
learned how to fight. I learned about the darkness; about it’s desire;
about it’s attacks; about it’s strengths and weaknesses; and most
importantly I learned how to manifest the power of my own spirit in
battle with the darkness. I found within myself spiritual weapons. I
fought my own darkness, my own inner leviathan, and I grew strong. I
grew tough. I grew undefeatable, immortal, within my own psyche.

I don’t know how long it took to reach Spook, perhaps it was months; or
maybe it took a year, or many years; or perhaps it took a millenium. I
believe the more likely would be a thousand years yet in this place a
moment is like an eternity of emptiness and inner pain. Regardless of
how long it took Spook remained alive, I knew it in the deepest part of
my soul. I never doubted it for a moment. I just kept moving forward;
always moving forward. the only way out is forward; the only good is to
save Spook and so I move forward.

On the day I arrived I came to a bank on a river of blood. Spook lay on
the bank in tattered clothes. Spirits circled and taunted him
continuously and his body looked like a putrid corpse. Stinking,
rotting, slithering with worms. I thought at first I deluded myself in
thinking he was alive but that worm-eaten corpse sat up. His one
remaining eye widened in disbelief.

He said, “Susan?”

The guttural zombie-like tone is definately not Spook’s, yet it
definately is Spook. Is he ever a mess.

I said, “Spook? Jesus man what happened to you?”

He said, “What happened to you? You look like some crazy ass Sumerian
Goddess—”

Before he could finish I was on him trying to figure out how to help
him. I realized if he was going to be dead he would have been dead a
very long time ago. What happened to spook, well it’s unnatural. It’s
just, wrong. I tried picking out the worms and maggots and they fell to
dust then another would appear in it’s place. Necrotized flesh healed
itself but only back to it’s original necrotized condition. Spook’s
state was the closest thing to a zombie I could imagine. I don’t know
what to do. I have no idea.

Spook said, “Susan I don’t know how you got here but I the path I chose
in life led me here. I filled this river with blood and stole the life
from my own body. I don’t know how you found me but go find your own
rest and leave me be.”

I said, “I’m taking you back with me Spook, I won’t leave you here.”

He said, “Or you can fly off with those wings and lay an egg. I am not
in any way going off to a vampire afterlife with you.”

I said, “Spook this is not the afterlife, last I remember you were alive
and not so well back on earth. You went mad.”

He said, “Damn. warlocks madness. That explains some things. This didn’t
seem like any sort of afterlife I knew of. I think this place may be on
the astral plane Susan. That’s been my presumption. I guess I should
have been more careful using black magic after my half vampire side
died. The road to hell is paved with the best intentions they say.”

I said, “You think you might know something of this place?”

He said, “I’m not sure really, only theories I researched in my magical
work. The astral plane is infinate and is formed by us when we choose to
travel and build a domain there. The madness of black magic is a choice
of will. It never seemed to me after seeing a mad warlock that it was in
fact them there. Their eyes were just, empty of soul. Some degree of my
theory appears to be true.”

I said, “Do you know how to get the hell out of here?”

He said, “Oh tell me it ain’t so. You came all the way here with no idea
how to get back?”

I said, “I only had the one chance to get here as far as I knew. I had
to take it, and figure out the rest as I went.”

He said, “Oh pity the fool, I can get us home, but I need to get access
to my astral temple. It’s a wizard’s tower and has been across this
river ever since I got here. I tried to swim across it but the tide
pulled me back everytime. It’s part of the cruelty of this place I
believe, that I should see my salvation within reach and yet I have been
prevented from reaching it.”

I said, “What exactly was it like here Spook? What really went on?”

He said, “A dark fog had been growing around me ever since my vampire
half died. I seemed to offend people but I didn’t know why. I had
thoughts of attaining power that I didn’t have before. It didn’t take me
long to realize it was the warlock’s madness coming on me because I felt
it grow worse when I used my dark powers to assist the team. I thought I
had it under control until this happened. I guess I was still wounded
from before I was partly turned years ago. I just caused more scarring
on top of what had already taken place so many years ago.

“I didn’t realize what would happen. It was so sudden. It was like my
spirit was pulled under from a strong tide and I sank to the bottom of a
cold black abyss. I landed here. It feels like it’s been a millenium. I
found scraps of trash and built that little five foot doghouse over
there out of torn aluminum roofing to sleep in. These bleeding
riverbanks are abundant with filth and trash. Nowhere else on the
horizon did I see anything but wasteland, trees and dust. Yet here there
was garbage piled around me. I was thrown in a heap of trash as if to
say this is what you’re worth. I gathered some filthy clothes for myself
out of here and tried to get by. I am always hungry but there is no
food, thirsty but all there is to drink is blood from the river. Yet
despite this I do not die. Soon after I got here sores started breaking
out on my body. Worms broke free from the sores and they spread. My
flesh was constantly being consumed endlessly. My worms never die, if I
kill any others appear to take their place. No matter what I do I cannot
die. Like you said I am deathless, and as far as I know I’ve been here a
thousand years.

“Every moment I hope for death, but it never comes. I hope for an end to
my pain but it never stops. Yet across that river might be my salvation
and I think maybe I might reach it but I never do, the tides always pull
me back. Even though I might be feet from the shore they pull me back
and throw me into despair. Year after year I rest but never sleep, fight
my thoughts, and endure my pain. I wash my clothes in a river of blood
and wash my body with my tears.

“I have been told madness and condemnation come to those who choose the
dark side and the ways of black magic. Yet even as I sit here in my own
hell I will still swear that not all that choose the darkness are evil,
and not all black magic is diabolical. What of those who curse a cancer?
what of those who hex madness or bring death upon starvation? How about
those who return life to those die senselessly despite the skill of the
surgeon, or heal the psyche of the person villainously attacked by an
evil wizard?

“The white council of wizards condemn all these things because this is
our end. I condemn them for not helping us who use dark power to help
others. I hope to see them here for their calculating ways, in not
helping us find the cure for the dark physicians who do for others what
no one else can.”

Howls erupted around us. Emerging from the landscape came some manner of
hellhounds. Not what might be seen in the Fae, their skin as tight to
their flesh looking mangy and leathery, like a corpse. Fire poured out
from their eyes and mouth, as well as parts of their body that seemed
uncovered by their terrible flesh. They howled again then roared with an
unearthly sound. Slowly they encircled us and stepped forward.

I said, “Spook, these friends of yours?”

He said, “Hardly, one often comes at night and mauls me. I would assume
it would kill me but I am unsure whether I might consider myself alive
or dead in my current condition.”

I stood in front of Spook and lifted myself into the air on my wings,
spreading them wide, and unfurling my talons ready for battle. The
hounds stood wide eyed at me, then backed up one step. They shook their
head and sneezed fire, continuing forward with a roar.

I said, “Spook I apologize ahead of time, this might just hurt a
little.”

He said, “What? What is going to hurt? I’ve had enough hurt Su—”

I grabbed him quickly with my foot talons as the hounds dove for us and
I pulled us hard into the air. I threw him up into the air and grabbed
him in my arm. The squirming of his worms reminded me that he is better
in my claws, forgive me for saying it. I dropped him and grabbed him
with my foot talons again.

He said, “What the hell did I ever do to you?”

I said, “Sorry Spook, you’re just really disgusting right now. Bite down
on a talon if it helps but I’m not wearing your worms I’m sorry dude.”

He said, “I’ve suffered worse than this in recent memory, all things
considered though I would really prefer not to suffer at all.”

I said, “Preaching to the choir brother, preaching to the choir.”

![image](Images/hrule.png)

We heard a screech from above and what would appear to be undead birds
of prey descending. Only half their feathers remained on their body and
their skin was dry, leathery and tightly stuck to their bones. Their
legs were nothing but bone and talons and there were holes in their
skin. Smoke poured out of them especially from the holes into their
ribcage. Smoke, oily black smoke, poured out of their beaks and empty
eye sockets. We heard splashing from below and seen a manner of fish to
whose fearsome features were many magnitudes greater than even the most
horrifying abyssal fish. All the creatures were mansized or somewhat
larger.

These abominations were headed straight for us.

I pulled a loop straight up into the air as a wave of birds flew past
brandishing their talons for the strike. I continued the loop down again
as Spook was letting off a long string of obscenities in spite of the
G-Forces he endured. Behind me three more flocks were bearing down,
closing the gap between us as I flew as fast as I could. I was burdened
by Spook though and there was no way I could outrun them. The hellish
fish below in the river of blood jumped out of the water to observe and
bear their teeth hoping for us to freefall into their reach. Some of the
fish, all of which looked as dead as every other creature here, seemed
to have what could best be described as resembling shrunken heads. Not
actually shrunken but very distinctly human, like a corpse long dead. It
made me ponder the nature of these creatures.

I said, “Spook, some of these monstrous things seems to have human
features, do you suppose they are other mad black sorcerors?”

He said, “Susan, considering the deathless way I look I’m pretty sure
they are. I don’t know how they came to be animal like but I concur.”

I said, “Why are they not human?”

He said, “I’ve only been here a short time, I still have flesh although
it is quite broken. My anger has become greater and greater as I’m
attacked night after night. These creatures who used to be humans may
have been here for thousands upon thousands of years, and have been
twisted in ways I dare not imagine. They are no more human now than this
horrible and diabolical place is wholesome.”

I agreed. We need to destroy these things somehow, and destroy the
horrors of this place. There must be a way.

A bird dives from above striking my left shoulder, I spiral downward and
lose my grip on Spook. He spirals downward towards the demon fish
blasting obscenities all the way, “Jesus Chriiiii—”

I dive straight for him but one of the birds crashes into my from the
side, a beak plunging toward my left eye but I counter attack and throw
my head to the side. It screams and black oily smoke pours out smelling
like smouldering flesh. I throw it with my talons but it’s own talons
grab into my shoulder and a beak plunges into my back. I scream and
start into a free fall. The fish below thrash the blood of the river
into a fowl foam anticipating the meal. Another bird comes from the side
and slashes across my ribs as I try to throw the foul creature off my
back. The second bird comes back for a second run and I throw my back
towards him. He lands his talons deep into the first bird and I hear it
scream. It releases it’s claws from my back and I push it away from me.
The two birds start fighting each other fiercely falling towards the
river. I manage to get my wings working again and push hard toward Spook
but it’s too late. He is engulfed by one of the monstrous fish.

Then as the fish closes it’s mouth a bird hits Spook on the side. It is
consumed by the fish and I catch spook, skimming the river. Avoiding one
fish after another I’m still wounded by dozens of smaller fish of
different sizes. As I’m desperately trying to pull back up into the air
Spook hits the river and said, “bloody fucking hell what are you doing
Susa—”

I tumble into the river and see a glimpse of the birds being taken one
by one by the fish above. Two flocks appear to have fled already. As I
hit the water a large fish comes out and hits me hard from below sending
me and spook into the air. Spook is again knocked out of my talons into
the air and the frenzy of the fish below is continuing to intensify. A
huge fish launches itself at Spook but doesn’t quite make it to him and
Spook said, “Goddamned motherfucking Moby Dick Jesus H Christ Susan—”

I push my wings hard and snatched him with the talons of my hands and
threw him up into the air as another huge fish comes up. I navigate
myself away from it’s maw but I get hit nonetheless. I manage to form my
talons into a hoof again and use the momentum to push myself to Spook. I
unfold my foot claws and snatch him out of the air as three birds head
our way. I pull ourselves down hard toward the river as the beaks and
talons of the birds strike each other and they too begin to fight each
other. I noticed the pattern here. I grab Spook by both hand and foot
talons and head toward the water as Spook curses my name and many varied
and creative ways. I skim the surface of the water only just touching
the surface of the water and the frenzy of fish explode out of the river
behind us. Most of the flock get consumed as some try to dodge the fish
and others try to fight them. Another flock start towards us from the
front causing their own frenzy behind them. These Kamakaze creatures
won’t back down from a fight, they are so evil they are stupid. They are
nothing but emotional and act according to the vile anger and
maliciousness that consumes them. They are easily tricked.

The flock is getting closer. If I pull up they are going to have me, if
I slow down the fish will have me. Move to the side they turn to the
side and have me as sure as if I went up. Only one way to go.

I push hard and gain speed. I move faster; I keep moving faster; the
birds keep getting closer. Any moment now they’ll be here. They’re
almost here.

Run hard, Run fast
==================

move Spook up towards me, and pull down even closer to the water. As I
see the smoke from the lead birds eyes I touch down of the river and
begin hydroplaning. I lay myself as close to the river as possible with
my wings raised slightly ready for action. As I skim over the river I
bump the occasional bird as I move at incredible speed. The action of
touching the river stirred the fish to launch into the air behind me
consuming the birds I move past. Before I lose all my speed or push my
wings out and use the last momentum to flap and move myself 5 feet into
the air and move of as the fish consume the last of the surprised birds
behind me.

The flocks are decimated now, only a few remain. Most of them are
attacking each other and one by one fall to be consumed by the fish. One
of the few remaining creatures, which is heavily injured, flies toward
me to make a final attack. I move Spook down to my foot talons and grab
the creature by the neck. I break the bones of it’s limbs to completely
hobble it. I look into it’s eyes to try to find a spirit, a spirit that
exists in all creatures. I must have a spirit, even if it is deathless
it is still a creature.

Nothing. There is no aura. There is no spirit. Only evil is left.

I see in it every dark and terrible nature of man. First and foremost I
see madness. Within the madness I see: anger, arrogance, bitterness,
coldness, paranoia, rage, resentment, envy, cruelty, selfishness,
hatred, viciousness and of course violence.

It is sad that a person can be consumed by darkness but I never thought
I would ever see someone consumed to the point where the spirit is
utterly destroyed. I never thought I would see such horror.\
I break it’s neck, and throw it to the fishes.\
Time to move on.\
We fly off resuming the course we had started in. The remaining
creatures fight each other, flee, or get consumed. They no longer pay
any attention to us. Now I know why. They prey on the weak, and heed the
strong resentfully waiting for their chance for treachery. We have
proven ourselves strong, and we are going to leave this evil game to
these creatures in their wretchedness.

There is no redemption for these creatures; there is no redemption for
this place; there is no spirit to be found in this place, only
abominations of life that once was diabolically animated to mock the
life that once was.

Why did this happen? What has created this horror, this place?

I said, “Dear God Spook what happened here? Why did this happen?”

He said, “I wish I knew Susan. To some warlocks this is justice but to
many this fate is a crime. No one has the answer, even though many
warlocks have searched for a cure for this fate none have yet found it.”

I said, “Is there no way to evoke the magic to do the same things
without descending into the accursed place?”

He said, “No. Anyone who uses the black magic, who bends magic too far
will come here. Even using black magic a single time will create a draw
on a warlock to use it again. Every time a warlock uses dark magic the
draw gets stronger and the damage to their ethereal body becomes worse
and worse.”

I said, “Yet the half vampires could use the black magic with impunity.”

He said, “Yeah. We were impregnated with undeath, we had the dark nature
within us by being infected by the red court. Now we don’t.”

I said, “So what happens now? Can we destroy this place?”

He said, “No. This place is part of the curse that we don’t know how to
undo.”

I said, “So what happens then? If there aren’t any more half vampires to
work dark magic for good purposes? In the fellowship it was part of our
burden, there was a lot of dark warlocks among us to do healing that no
others could.”

He said, “Susan I don’t know what happens. I guess dark warlocks just
have to make a choice to follow the dark path, and accept the destiny
that will come to them. I don’t even know if there are enough people
with magical talent sufficient to replace those that are lost. Maybe in
the end more people will die from magical and ethereal disease and
that’s just the way it will be.”

I said, “Spook that’s horrible. No way, I’ve seen the horrors in these
creatures but I’ve seen worse horror in the ethereally ill. Left as a
vegetable, with an ethereal body torn to shreds in horrifying ways.
Destined to live all eternity suffering in pain from wounds that never
heal and a body that can’t release them to the afterlife. I could never
imagine how terrible a fate that is anymore than I could imagine the
destruction of a spirit like these once mad warlocks had undergone. I
only hope that most of these were truly evil in life.”

He said, “They were. The majority of dark warlocks seek wealth and power
through magic. They were evil before they even took up magic. It’s the
minority, the well intentioned dark healers that share the same fate.
It’s unimaginable that there is no way to stop the carnage.”

We just need to get to Spook’s tower, find a way out of here. I don’t
want to spend another minute here to consider the injustice that
surrounds me. I don’t want to even think about it anymore. It’s wrong in
every imaginable way.

I said, “Spook, when we get to your tower what do we do, to get out I
mean?”

He said, “My ethereal tower has all the magical material I own. It is
not only duplicated but books and equiment that are long lost to time
remain in my tower safe from anything that would ruin them. My tower
here has been here since I was an apprentice and will be here until my
dying day. Probably even after I pass. It’s the nature of the Astral,
even though time passes quickly here nothing that has come into being
here ever will cease to be.”

I said, “Time passes quickly here?”

He said, “Yes, quite quickly. I can work and study a long time here and
time in the real world has not passed as far. I never measured the
difference but there is definitely a difference. I have an exit spell
that I used once, it worked well, it is an emergency spell but
unfortunately it does take some time to cast properly. I’ve been here a
millenia already I’m pretty sure so what’s a little more time?”

I said, “You and me both, or so it would seem anyway. This God awful
place is an abomination unto itself.”

There was a magic circle set into the ground inscribed with strange
sigils. Spook said they were the sigils of the four elements.

All still remains quiet. we climb up into the tower. I was startled by
an unearthly growl to see an animated corpse. I spring back and prepare
to destroy the monstrosity when Spook calmly places his hand on my
shoulder.

“It’s my own creation Susan, it wont attack any friend of it’s master.
The soul has long since departed and it is no use leaving their shell to
waste. The former owner certainly has no use for it now.” said Spook.

I said, “How many of these are here?”

He said, “About half a dozen, and in the crypt below the tower roam the
oldest servants skeletons and mummified corpses. I don’t let any
creation go to waste.”

I shudder, yet he smiles. He is without a doubt a true warlock to find
this necromancy acceptable. I’m glad he’s on our side. Dear God the
smell, the unholy smell of rotting flesh. I can’t help but gag yet
manage to get it under control.

“My library is on the third floor.” said Spook.

We climb up and see endless shelves of books. As far as the eye could
see. This library is far larger than should fit into the tower we
entered which was quite small in circumference.

I said, “I take it the usual laws of physics don’t apply here?”

He said, “Precisely. I define the laws of existence in this realm of
mine in the astral. My library is infinite, although sadly more often
than not mostly redundant. What you see is vanity.”

I said, “Good. I couldn’t figure out how you acquired all this in your
short lifetime.”

He said, “A magical exercise in recursion. Over here, third shelf down.
Let me see—”

Just then we heard the most horrible scream coming from outside the
tower, still some distance away. We looked at each other and his zombie
minions grabbed polearms. With a growl they shuffled down the stairs.

I said, “What was that?”

He said, “Inspiration. Lets get what we need and get the hell out of
here.”

He described the book he needed. Bound in human flesh I found the
grimoire and he let out his breath in relief. He disappeared on the next
level up with some ingredients. He had stones, herbs, oils and other
items. We continued down and checking the grimoire he gathered items of
flesh. I dare not ask what exactly they were or where they came from.
Once on the ground floor he began setting up candles at four points.
chanting he dusted around the circle holding the grimoire, reciting
words of power as he went. A purple light began to eminate from the
circle and black oily smoke arose smelling like burning flesh. I could
hear distant sounds of crying and screaming coming from the general
direction of the circle. Spook gently touched my shoulder and led me
with him into the circle.

The door smashed open.

The spell shattered as I entered the circle, the landscape around us
filled with deafening screams as the tower broke to pieces. We are sent
hurling into darkness as the world around us seemed to consume itself
into a break in reality, consumed by a black hole that left behind
complete nothingness. Where once was a land and sea that nearly consumed
us now we are witness to the horrible plane having consumed itself.

Are we next to be pulled into this darkness, to meet our doom?

Free falling
============

he darkness slowly began to burn away and I seen that Spook and I were
high in the air above a precipice. I could make out a small group of
people below.

As we continued in a soon to be fatal plunge I noticed I have returned
to human form and Spook noticed the same wide eyed. I can’t hear, the
sound of wind rushing around me is too intense. I can’t reach Spook. We
hurtle closer and I see it is our group down there. Time has passed we
are somewhere else. Over the precipasse I see a huge encampment. Vast
expanses of medical tents are surrounded by armed forces. Fellowship
forces. We found the encampment we’ve been looking for.

Directly below us there is a pire. The bodies of me and spook lie on it.

Sarg lights a torch, me and spook are waving our arms and yelling as the
pire is lit. What is this? We can’t be in two places at once? I notice
we are hurtling straight for our bodies. I wave to Spook, it took him a
minute before he cleared his thoughts and realized we need to go faster
not slower. We aren’t falling to our doom we are racing to save our
lives. We need to reunite to our bodies before it’s too late.

We tucked ourselves into olympic divers pose and slipped through the air
like a knife through butter. We pulled ourselves in tight hoping for
once two people might attain to break the law of terminal velocity.

We get closer, and closer. The fire is spreading up the pire. We can see
the flames strike only feet away from our bodies. I have an idea. I pull
Spook closer, aiming our dive at the fire. He waves his arms in
confusion and I make a swooping gesture to explain. He smiles. If we are
rejoining our bodies it might cause a physical jolt. If we aim for the
fire we might be snapped laterally into our bodies and the jolt might
roll us away from the fire. Maybe.

Everything went black.

The next thing we see is our people standing over us, Bones is kneeling
down checking us over.

“What happened?” I said.

“You tell us” Bones said.

“That was unexpected. Jesus what the hell happened?” said Spook.

“I think it’s clear noone knows what happened. Do you two know what
happened in the last couple days? We assumed you were braindead and
decided to light you up. There are no words to describe how shitty I
feel right now. I almost killed someone I love. I don’t think I can ever
forgive myself—” Jill said.

“You didn’t know hun. How could you have? If I was braindead to bring my
body to peace would be an act of mercy. An act of love even. It will be
ok.” I said.

“well, at least I can say we aeem to have made it. Just below that bluff
is the Fellowship encampment we were looking for. I know from Sarg this
is definately it.” Jill said.

“How long were we gone?” I said.

“A few days, doc seen to it you were provided sustenance intraveneously.
You and Spook too of course. We would never have put you on a funeral
pire otherwise please understand Susan.” Jill said.

“Its ok Jill I understand. No worries.” I said.

I looked down and seen a huge encampment. We stood at the top of a
towering embankment and seen the entirety of the camp. There was a long
road leading down to it but from here I seen a vast tent city. There was
a long series of huge tents marked with a red cross indicating a medical
encampment that could hold what looked like twenty thousand souls.
Surrounding the medical facility was a well provisioned military
presence, and a fully intact airport which was our greatest hope. I can
get out and bring help to our cause thank God. Things are finally
looking up. What horrors lie in those medical tents though, is it for
the care of earthly wounds or the horrors of the supernatural unleashed
on defenseless people? In tgis part of the world it’s hard to know. I’m
hopeful it’s not the latter.

“Well, I feel like an asshole so let’s move on and start marching
towards our salvation down there. I think that’s what matter the most
right now. Every one of us has a place in cleaning uo this mess whether
we admit it or not and you all know it. All of us start makinf things
right down there by God” said Sarg.

It wasn’t terribly eventful on that journey but me and Spook had time to
talk over the past events. I was so far from underatanding what
happened.

“There is something very dangerous in you Susan, nothing like I’ve ever
seen or heard by word of mouth. I don’t know what to make of it .” said
Spook.

“How do you figure Spook?” I said.

“Well, really it’s what happened in the incantation. I don’t see any
reason why there should be such a reaction to you entering upon it. The
only reason it should create such havoc is as if you were the sourcw
from whixh all dark energy flowed. It just doesn’t make sense Susan no
matter what form you may take. There has been a change in the fabric of
the plane as a result. It indicates you are more than you appear and yet
still you are just Susan there has to be another explanation.” Spook
said.

I said, “What are you talking about Spook? A change in the fabric of the
planes? What planes?”

Spook said, “ The part of the ethereal plane that we are aware of. Since
we left I had a chance to scry upon it to aee what has taken place. It
is without form. The evil of the darkness has somehow been dispelled. it
is without order if it makes anu sense to you. The best way I can
discribe it is that that part of the astral has been unmade since our
passing. The evil has been expelled but to where I don’t know. It would
take an intelligence of extreme power to do what I perceive has been
done. I need to maintain humility in the matter though Susan I may be an
experienced warlock but I can only say be damned careful there is a
primeval and terrifying power about you.”

I said, “Understood Spook. I honestly don’t know what is going on with
me. Not since have I had any idea what is going on with me. Pray God if
you know anything please tell me Spook I don’t know what is going on.”

> Spook said, “I don’t either Susan honestly. I’ve seen power, earthly

I said, “Jesus.”

He said, “It’s well and good you might be a vampire as your heart is the
heart of a hero in spite of your nature. There are few benevolent
vampires in existence and certainly you are one of the good ones. Be a
vampire with the power expected of a vampire Susan. Get away from this
power you currently have safely, but expeditiously. This situation you
are in is very dangerous for everyone and everything.

“The curse is broken. You deserve to know that. The bane of the warlock
is no more. We aren’t chained to the fate of madness anymore. Madness
will only come if we are found wanting in our psychology. Since time
immemorial we have been afflicted and even the gods who seen fit to
break the curse could not. Respect this power Susan, if you can set it
aside do it the good you can do isn’t worth the risk.”

I’m shaking. I’m terrified and cold to the bone. I trust Spook and he
expressed well the danger of the power I’m holding in my hands. I want
to walk away but what if it falls into the wrong hands? Spook is
thinking of me too in what he says, but unless I knew this terrible
power were placed in the right hands how could I risk setting it aside?
How would I even know the god I should entrust it with would be a wise
caretaker of such a thing? I have so much to think about.

The journey to the camp was fairly uneventful. the descent was slow as
we travelled on a trail that was cut into the side of a sheer cliff. A
couple times I had a sense of something cool and wet on my shoulder but
when I touched my shoulder there was nothing there. The way things are
here in central america I figure if it isn’t trying to kill me then it’s
alright. Presumably it was real that is Spook had me very, well, spooked
earlier.

We set camp for the night. One more days march should get us there. We
did get down the cliff though. We are settling into an overgrown area
for the night to stay hidden, having hacked into a small clearing with
machetes.

Jill was entering into the tent I shared with my companions. I caught
her arm gently before she went in.

I said, “Jill, I’m going to sleep alone tonight. I’m not really hungry.”

She said, “Oh Susan we didn’t know, please don’t turn away from us you
know we need you. It’s been a long time and our troubles are starting to
return to us.”

I said, “Oh no no it’s not that Jill, I’m just shaken over my
experience. Everything is ok with us. I just need some time alone to
think that’s all. It was difficult and terrible unlike you could imagine
and I need to digest it all.”

Jill said, “I’m not sure I believe you but I trust you. Just remember I
love you and if there’s anything you need come get me.”

I said, “Absolutely. I definately will. Thanks hun.”

We hugged long and hard.

I grabbed a sleep system pack and let Sarg know where I was crashing
out, some distance from camp. He paused, yet didn’t take long to realize
why. Not a word more needed to be said. He gave a nod to me and turned
back to the sentry for the night leaving me and Spook out of rotation.

In the wee hours of the night I heard a rustle. I woke up and seen
something that looked like a goth. Ambiguous looking with straight and
long flowing black hair, and whose eyes looked like the depths of the
ocean. In a moment my kabar was in my hands and I leapt clear of my
sleeping bag to slowly circle the stranger. I need to drop this fool
before someone gets hurt.

I said, “Who are you? What is your purpose here?”

He said, “You are my purpose Susan. You are lost.”

I said, “I know exactly where I am, I think you should consider yourself
lost if you think you can overtake our group. How many of you are
there?”

He said, “I am one but we are many, I have not come to fight but it
would please me to meet your blade in battle. Prepare yourself then.”

I said, “You haven’t answered my questions. Answer me one then, who are
you?”

He said, “Of course, pardon my failure of etiquette. My name is
Leviathan, and I am dæmon. We meet again Susan”

Oh shit.

Situation Desperate
===================

uietly in the still of the night we circle each other again, this time
in human form.

I said, “Why do you stalk me? What am I to you?”

He said, “You are my sister though you do not know me.”

I said, “I have no family. I have no brother. A fine brother you would
be to do battle with your supposed sister anyway.”

He said, “Hah, dæmon is always ready for battle my sister. As above so
below, existance is a struggle, the clash of swords, the victory and the
defeat. The way of war is the way of life and of our existence for we
are existence.”

He stood at ease and raised his hands palm up.

He said, “Will you stand down my sister and hear my wisdom?”

I stood easy and slowly opened my palms, my kabar resting easily in my
open palm. Slowly I returned my blade to my sheath and we stood facing
each other. I’m still very much on edge.

I said, “Speak.”

He said, “I am Leviathan. I am dæmon. I am not the Leviathan of evil
legend, I am not that same creature. Me and my kind bear accursed names
but we are spirits replete with wisdom. I am dæmon of water. In this I
am no god of water I am water. I am the very element made manifest. As
long as creation has been and as long as it will be so also will there
be dæmon for we are creation.

You are the reason men fear the dark;you are the reason they fear the
night. The events of were a quickening. A catalyst as it were, to bring
you forth in power. Ever since you have been you were the same, only now
you are blooming into your true self. Fear not yourself.

I needed to speak to your learned elder aspect, now accessible to me
since , to do so I needed to weaken you enough to cause her to come
forth so I battled with you. You are beloved to me Susan, and I am at
peace with you now.”

I said, “You’re long winded dude. So basically you say I’ll be fine, and
I got some juice. So what if I fuck up and like blow the world up?”

He said, “Just don’t.”

I said, “That inspires confidence.”

I decided to nickname him Levi. It helps me differentiate him from the
biblical reference and it’s just easier all around. I guess I got more
juice than an east German female powerlifter. Not that I know what I’m
doing yet. Give a kid some nitro glycerin and tell them not to blow
themselves up. Good idea. Fucking .

In the afternoon of the next day we arrive at camp. It became apparent
that the tents were full of victims addicted to venom. The bad ones.
Just like any bad drug some people are more susceptable to addictions
than others. Some life-threatening in fact if the drug were removed too
quickly. These are the bad cases. Many are restrained. Many show signs
of blown voice boxes from screaming. Most are cadaverous from not eating
and limited intravenous because they thrash too much to keep the iv in.
Most are restrained, most show self-mutilation like gouging out their
own eyes or peeling the skin from their own face and body. A man in the
distance is being worked on after the stress caused him to have a heart
attack. He looked like he was in his mid 20s. They are heavily addicted
and suffered horribly. Many have given up hope and died by their own
hand so that they need not suffer anymore. A majority are afflicted with
some manner of madness often mocking the nurses saying the reds are the
masters and will return soon to exact vengeance great will it be to
serve at their feet great will it be to die by their hand. There is no
cure, they have faint hope of living long before the withdrawl kills
them, a month on average or so I’ve seen before.

It’s like hell on earth. Fucking red court vampires.

It took no time at all for the sentries to intercept us. we identified
ourselves with an old sign countersign. So we were just detained rather
than stripped of belongings and thrown in the clink. I give thanks for
small wonders. We met the general who said, “either you’re a useful
asset and you stay or youre useless and you go. We dont have the
resources to keep any nonessential personnel here. So choose.” Needless
to say we found ourselves being useful. Me and Spook took the first
assignment as working with the warlocks in their research tent because
we told the general about our recent adventure. I mostly organized tomes
and scrolls while Spook worked doing actual research.

![image](Images/hrule.png)

A familiar face came running up to me while I was on sentry. Geoffrey,
from the house of Windsor in the UK. Anotherwards a member of the royal
family.

When the reds were still around some British representatives were
present here. In one of the fellowship raids I freed them when they were
held hostage. It was in our best interest to clue in the monarchy and
get their support in our resistance. So we took the risk to free them
and send them back with some fangs procured from dying reds. Needless to
say they clued in and we had support that was desperately needed.

He said, “Lady Rodriguez, it has been a long time. I see things are
changed but not better here. It is a travesty the people of central and
south America are so relentlessly afflicted. Pray God should have mercy
on these suffering souls.”

Oh yeah. I was knighted for my courage by the queen in a fairly secret
manner. It doesn’t change anything in my day to day life so I often
forget the fact.

I said, “Wassup Geoffrey?”

He said, “I’m acting as an attache to the queen. She wants to know what
is happening down here. Her wizards reported a massive release of black
magic some time ago. I’m told the reds were consumed in the release and
the fellowship here reported a truly historic event at . Needless to say
it was assumed you were burnt to dust. I’m glad you are well but what
happened to you?”

I said, “I woke up with the world’s worst hangover.”

He said, “ok. You could just say you don’t know. There’s no reason to
always drip sarcasm you know.”

I grunted.

He said, “Well, anyway. I’m looking to take the first flight out to
report back are you leaving north I assume? Your journalistic ways are
less useful down here than educating the northerners on this tragedy.”

I said, “Exactly my thought. I’ll need to figure out how to get noticed
but I need to drum up support from up north somehow.”

We met the base commander, a general Kraghstrom. He advised me my
journalistic background makes me first pick for a mission north. An
outbreak of zombies seems to be underway and it carries the risk of
apocalypse if it is viral based. When I return he will see that I am on
the next flight north to undertake whatever means necessary to get
support to us down here.

That night I walked among the tents and considered these latest events.
I laid plans to achieve my goals.

This could move me closer to having enough clout to be heard up north if
I can report something credible. Nobody north of Mexico will believe raw
stories of demons and zombies. Something believable is what I need. That
will carry my message to the eyes of those whose support we need most.

I can get closer to my daughter. I am always her mom in my heart and I
need to be close to her but am I still her mom in body? I’ve undergone a
tremendous physical change that goes far beyond what I could ever
understand. Oh little Maggie, your mother is dead, long live your
mother.

Ten days of cleaning; of walking sentry; of guarding the sick.

One night I was on patrol after sunset in the camp. As I wandered by an
area dedicated to research many researchers are on edge, and competing
with each other to find a cure. Only one of these researchers was having
undeniable success yet her continued research was threatened.

I heard loud angry voices coming from her research tent.

“We can save them dammit, general I just need more venom to complete my
research my test subjects have shown improvement”, said the woman.

“Are you telling me you experimented on multiple patients? You know I
only authorized you to work on one patient”, said the general.

“How am I supposed to make progress with a cure with a single test
subject? When I seen it help one of them how could I bear to keep it
from the others? Look at the suffering of these souls, surely we will be
held to judgement on what we do here while they live”, said the woman.

The woman waved her hand over the multitude of patient tents.

“You’re right Jane, we will be judged. Surely we will also be judged if
our pride leads us to harm these people in spite of such suffering. I
won’t cause it and I won’t allow you to cause it. you have the one man
and only one man and I won’t jeopardize a mission to obtain more venom
from old fellowship camps. it is only good to ease some people back.
Very few. This work of yours is fruitless. Expect me to pull you from
this self-glorifying project soon and put you into another project.”

“No you will not do that, I won’t let you. This will work I just need
more venom, I can synthesize more if I can isolate it’s makeup. I am so
close to creating a powerful anti-toxin that reverses the craving and
lets the body heal. it works. The recipient isn’t showing the signs like
the others if I complete my work I will have created a praise Jesus cure
for these people. You need to understand this is the only hope for these
people. This needs to happen. Get me the goddamned venom”, said Jane.

“Tell you what. If you pack up your belongings and report to Colonel
Bennett by Friday I won’t demote you to sentry duty. Besides if you spit
in a beaker you will find you have quite enough venom already.”, said
the general.

“Fuck you Joe. You’re damned right I have venom for you, this is fucking
bullshit. You’re betraying me, you gave me your word I could research
and test until I found a cure. What’s changed?”, said Jane.

“Venom. You need venom for this work and very little was kept by the
fellowship over the years. Even if you only need it until you are able
to fabricate the necessary components how do you know we are going to
find any more out there at all? This is likely a dead end and without
venom it is most assurredly a dead end. The Colonel has a good chance
and could use the help. Most importantly the Colonel doesn’t need any
goddamned venom for his proposed cure. It’s realistic.”, said Joe.

At that Joe walked away, and Jane took an old pipe and smashed a nearby
table into pieces. Her face still red she walks back to her desk to read
a research report but drops it. She violently sweeps everything off her
desk and combs her fingers through her hair.

Curious I stealthily enter the tent. she isn’t moving. Looking around I
see some relevant material on her research. I can’t understand medical
research myself but Laura might. I’ll get her to look at it.

As I’m leaving Jane turns around, “Who the hell are you?”

“Um. I’m Susan. I overheard that conversation you had with the
general—”, I said.

“What business do you have eavesdropping on a private conversation?”,
she said.

“Lady that conversation was anything but private. Is muffin getting a
bit tired? Do you need to go down for your afternoon nap? Momma ever
tell you to use your indoor voice asshat?”, I said.

She was so red with rage she was blind. I took the opportunity to snatch
a handful of paperwork, ducking just in time to evade the fist that
sailed quickly toward my jaw.

I backed away, and apologized. I slipped out of the tent and made my way
back for Laura to examine the journals.

“This is quite advanced Susan. She may in fact have done it but I don’t
think it’s possible to synthesize venom. Her work in that area is quite
far from a working solution. She is going to need venom.” said Laura.

I said, “Would any of this help you guys?” I said.

“No. Maybe synthesized venom but that is the weak area in her research
like I said. We don’t need freedom from addiction as you well know we
need the healing effects of venom.” she said.

I said, “I needed to ask. I just can’t be comfortable with my friends
being so dependant on me.”

She said, “I agree Susan. We’ve been together long enough I don’t feel I
need to butter you up anymore. On another level though all of us love
you dearly. You are the kindest and most caring vamp we’ve ever seen.”

I said, “Then there’s Jill—”

She said, “She loves you more than the air she breathes. She adored her
evil vampire masters as undeserving as they were. Now she finds a lover
in a really good and decent vampire. Heaven would have nothing better to
offer that woman. Please don’t start to glitter.”

I said, “If I do you have my permission to stake me.”

I shuddered.

She said, “If you don’t mind me asking, I never thought you played for
the other team?”

I said, “Subtle. No I never found I want any woman in any way like that
I just don’t want that. It’s an intense romantic involvement. I’m not
sure how else to explain it.”

She said, “That’ll do. Just wondering.”

So I knew as much as any other member of the fellowship we really didn’t
keep a stockpile of venom. There just wasn’t any need to do so. Jane is
fucked. So are those poor victims. Laura said flat out Jane is not near
enough to be able to synthesize venom if she ever will.

What are her options then? I could risk providing my own venom somehow
but I need to go north to get help and I need to ensure my thralls are
provided for as well although they are no burden to me realistically.
Providing like that puts me and my thralls in danger too, we don’t
really know these people. Raiding to obtain pre venom stocks is
unrealistic. She will need to produce venom somehow.

I shuddered. I better find out if she is truly sincere about her
willingness to do anything to help those people because unless I can
think of another answer there’s no way back from the road I would have
her travel.

Something new is about to come into this world with the power to either
save it or to destroy it. May the world forgive me if I have made the
wrong choice, but my choice is made and I am going to see it through.

Starting A Family
=================

he next afternoon Spook caught me on my way to finding another excuse
from going on nursing duty in the medical tents. I dislike the way the
patients seem to know exactly what I am and how it couldn’t be more
obvious to others that something is amiss if they threw themselves at my
fangs they’re so desperate to receive the venom. I have no idea how they
know I got it, they just seem to smell the red court on me.

He said, “Susan do you have some time this evening? I want to apologize
for what I said earlier about your powers, I didn’t mean for it to come
out the way it did. It is what it is. I’ve been doing nothing but
paperwork in the warlock’s area today and I’m going to be doing my daily
magical practise. I thought that perhaps we could get together and I
might help you in understanding your abilities. You were scheduled for
duty in the patient tents, I asked and they seemed relieved you could be
somewhere else. Something about the patients aren’t right when you’re
around. I’m not surprised.”

I said, “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Spook. Oh thank you.”

We stopped for some bangers and mash at the mess tent and retired to his
assigned tent. I think he’s the only one of us that was assigned his own
tent due to his being a warlock and thus his importance within the
fellowship at this time in history.

He said, “So what do you know so far about your new abilities?”

I said, “Fuck all. When I woke up in I was true form red court. That’s
still my most natural state if I’m tired or very hurt. Putting on a
flesh mask and holding it is some effort, but not much really. That
bird-like true form thing I’ve found I can turn into only when I’m being
true to myself. I have to be right in my heart. It’s about focusing on
what and who I am rather than just wrapping myself up in something. Once
I’m a bird though I can just stay that way I just need to refocus inside
if I want to change back to a bird. Not really a bird but I don’t know
what else to say about that form. I feel it’s my most powerful and
exalted form I’ve seen yet. I have the infamous venom, and the infamous
hunger. My eyes have strong hypnotic ability. I can see a lot more in
people with my vampire eyes. When I went to get you I seemed to have
transported myself by instinct. I don’t know how I did it. I have
mistform of course, good to pass walls or just plain disappear then
reappear somewhere else nearby. I can move around on any surface even
inverted like a spider. I can walk around during the day which many
vampires can’t. I’m not sure if it matters but I’m not bothered by cold
but love the heat. I’m sure I’ll find out more as time goes on.”

He said, “So it seems you’re a shapeshifter of sorts. That doesn’t say
much the reds were a bit like shapeshifters except that really they were
just wrapping themselves up in a mask. The bird shape as you call it,
that is real shapeshifting though which makes me think you have a
greater depth in that area. Look Susan I want to explore that a little
more tonight. What about the eyes Susan? Sometimes human, sometimes
black and sometimes white regardless of your form. Can you explain that
a little more?”

I said, “Yeah sure. It’s after dark now so it’s a little easier to show
you. Basically human eyes are human eyes. I can see farther and sharper
than other people but not much more. Honestly as the days go by I’m
learning new things about myself and new things are developing in me on
their own time. The bird form I didn’t know existed until it
spontaneously happened and over time I learned to better control it.
That’s the way with all of this. It’s just taking time.”

He said, “From my experience with certain entities that seems to be the
way. You might be able to do something one time then it just doesn’t
happen for you the next, like the long process of learning your
instincts naturally rather than an animals faultless instinct to
breathe.”

I said, “That’s about right yeah, I can’t really depend on anything
special I got except what I knew back as a half vampire. Well, and more
and more the bird form seems to be reliable. Now about the eyes—”

I switch over to vampire vision, my black eyes.

I said, “Now this is a busy set of eyes. The white eyes you seen are
just nictitating membranes to protect these vampiric eyes from the
daylight, and maybe other environmental hazards but I think mainly
sunlight. That way I have abilities and senses I would normally in
vampire form after dark. Pure white or pure black eyes are just
different forms of creepy. When I’m walking around I just have the human
eyes. In vampire vision the stimuli is huge I’m only now just scratching
the surface. A whole new range of colour, if you can say colour, is
available for me to see and I’m just going by instinct as to what I’m
seeing. I’m using it as an enhancement of watching body language. I know
what hungry looks like by watching people in the mess tent over time,
just studying what I see.”

He said, “Here I might be able to help with that. Do you have any
special ability to detect deathstone by any chance?”

I said, “No. No special sense of it. I wish I did.”

He said, “I wish you did too.”

He walked over to a bookshelf, trailed his finger along the spines of
each and withdrew one book carefully. It was a work composed by a still
existing magickal tradition. The name on it was The Secret Doctrine of
the Rosicrucians, Part XII, The Aura and Auric Colors.

He said, “I’ve found it to be quite accurate for me, and many of my
colleagues swear by this one. The ancient traditions have done a lot of
good work. Every person or group has it’s fallacies, each warlock needs
to determine for themselves what works for them best and some people I
know cannot use this tome. I would like to know which group you fall in
perhaps I can help in this area. Remember Susan don’t trust what you see
out of hand, I know magic that will alter or obscure my aura to the aura
of others and most warlocks possess the same abilities.”

I noted that little piece of information. We looked over the book
together and I found that from what I can recall my experiences
conformed to what was described in the book. Auric abilities are
powerful I can see that now. It’s a bit of a game to play though when I
consider what Spook said about how auras can be altered. What I read
does not completely encompass all the breadth and depth of what I see
through vampiric eyes but this does solve some of the mystery involved.
It gives me a foundation which I can learn with.

He said, “Now for the shapeshifting. Let’s take a walk it’s quite dark
out now.”

He grabbed some things and we headed out into the night by the light of
a fuel lantern. It is a very black night. It’s overcast, there is no
sign of neither moon nor star. Rain is likely coming soon it is humid
and still, a stillness like would come before a storm. He took us into
an area of the camp that is unused during the night but far enough away
from the camp borders that it isn’t ever patrolled. I made note of the
area, I think I could use this knowledge later.

He put down the lantern and turned to me. Taking some spell components
from a small leather pouch, he whispered some words in enochian and the
components were consumed.

He said, “Could you extend and retract your talons Susan? I want to try
and observe the underlying mechanism that causes the effect.”

His eyes glowed deep green. I did as he asked and a shadow of green
smoke passed over and through my hand as I did so. He looked at my arm.
He asked me what form I am in currently I said masked red court form. He
told me to expect a sharp poke and he drove an ice pick through my
forearm. No blood. The flesh appeared necrotic from the inside and I was
black as a rubber tire behind the flesh. He removed the ice pick and the
wound healed over as the ice pick was being extracted.

He said, “That’s a fast heal. Are you okay so far Susan?”

I said I was. He told me to expect a cutting sensation. He took a bowie
knife, I took the bowie from him. After a sincere petition that left him
with a black eye he gave me a local anesthetic. Just because I’m a fast
healer doesn’t mean I know no pain. Then he proceded to fillet my arm
from shoulder to wrist. The flesh came off and became a tar like
substance on the ground, and new flesh grew behind the blade as it was
cutting.

He said, “That’s a goddamned fast heal Susan. How are you feeling?”

I said, “Hungrier by the minute. I don’t think I should do much more
healing tonight Spook I’ll eat somebody.”

He said, “Understood. What about the hunger? What is your experience of
it?”

I said, “I’m not as hungry in the birdlike true form. As a matter of
fact I just kind of exist in that form with a manageable abiding hunger
that never goes away. If I’m too hungry then I’m too weak and vice versa
I can’t leave this red court form. For the time in which I’m in the bird
form though when I return to a red court form I’m neither more nor less
hungry that when I left it before except if there’s a reason I should
be, like I got hurt, which weakens me, eventually forcing me back to the
red court form. I feel better being the bird and I’m better off that way
I just can’t walk around that way indefinitely I just don’t fit in with
polite society. I’d rather just be human again anyway. It’s what I
always wanted but never got.”

He said, “Bite down on this leather, there’s going to be another poke in
the area I anaesthetized and it will hurt.”

I bit. He poked. I screamed into my other arm so as not to alarm anyone
nearby because that hurt like a motherfucker. I looked as I seen a
deathstone dagger snapping back into it’s handle. My arm had a hole. It
wasn’t healing. I could see straight through my upper arm although the
hole wasn’t a big one. Icepick size maybe. I looked over at Spook.

I said, “I’m going to shove that up your ass later. I take it this is a
further experiment?”

He said, “It is. If I help show you your shapeshifting ability might you
forego on inserting deathstone into my anus?”

I said, “Done. You show me that then I will owe you. What do you have in
mind?”

He said, “First shift to red court true form, I’ll check the wound and
you can do some exercises for me.”

I did. He nearly hurled on my talons. It is not a pleasing sight for
anybody and especially not for a fellowship soldier. I felt like I was
at the doctor’s getting a physical. He put on some thick gloves and used
a number of instruments to learn more about the slimy rubber composition
that is my H. R. Giger alien born of a vampire bat form. He checked the
wound which was still there from before. I changed to the bird form. The
wound remained still as it would in any form. Deathstone needs to heal
naturally. He analysed the action of my furling and unfurling of wings.
It made him smile. Then I did extending and retracting talons on both
hands and birdfeet. I curled my talons into hooves and the forming of
the digitigrade stance which I learned some time ago just out of
instinct. He pushed back against the curling of my talons and the
reshaping of my legs during the transition, and the action of entering
into a digitigrade stance made him smile again.

He said, “Susan everything you’re doing hints at shapeshifting. There is
significantly more conscious thought in the actions of entering your
digitigrade stance and the unfurling of your wings. Your wings appear of
fixed size but it appears you can unfurl them to have any span you want.
It is a supernatural capacity and it is true shapeshifting for every act
you take in refurling your wings. In taking the digitigrade stance, the
action is instinctual but the execution is a conscious effort. I see
that the folding of your talons is conscious when I had you push back
against me, and the same with the changing of your leg structure. You
were making a conscious effort in the change, and pushed back against me
in the ways I prescribed for you to do. You have full control in those 2
particular transformations and it is my presumption that if it is so
then you do have the capacity of a true shapeshifter. Let’s do another
exercise to see how far we can take this thought.”

He took some more components from his pouch, and with a few more words
of enochian his eyes went from green to leathery eye sockets with a
thick brown smoke in place of eyeballs. He had me turn into mistform,
and the smoke intermingled with my mistform in a way that seemed rather
intimate. I wasn’t very comfortable at first with the sensation but he
explained he was making a deep connection with my psyche in order to
guide my intuition and conscious action, helping me realize the actions
through which shapeshifting takes place. Reaching that deeper level is
what caused the sensation of intimacy, it is my psyche being protective
of itself. I felt things I never felt before. Things I didn’t know where
there. It was like someone was walking me around inside myself with a
lantern illuminating things I never knew were there. He helped me do
things within myself and it didn’t take me long before he said I was
ready to start learning on my own. He concluded his spell and I returned
to my birdform.

He said, “Now focus on me, remember what I showed you in mistform. Focus
on me, and be me.”

I did. I couldn’t see myself but he smiled big. He said it’s been a good
night and beckoned me to return to his tent to wrap up. He asked me to
focus on him again when we got back. Then take the internal actions I
was taught to gain the sense of being him. I did that. He asked me to
hold it and look in the mirror behind him. I did. I was him. He showed
me that I can bleed as a human, to see that I am true human. Completely
shapeshifted. I refocused my thought to become me again, and to project
myself contingently, to see my human self at my true age. I did it, and
I did it well. I have a couple wrinkles, I cut myself and I bleed, I’m
human. I rolled back into a red court form with flesh mask and lost my
older appearance but my wound healed. I’m hungry. I wasn’t hungry when I
was human but there was an effort sustaining the change.

He said, “You’ve done amazing tonight Susan. For a long time you are
going to find it rather draining maintaining a shapeshift for long. It
means it will drive you to feed more often. It will get better with
practise. I’ve worked with recessive populations of shapeshifters before
and I’ve learned some things about it. Also you will be able to more
easily shift into forms you are familiar with. Foremost your trueforms
which seem to be the birdform and the red court forms. In my work with
you it seems you resonate more with that birdform I think that’s your
genuine true form. The red court forms are a legacy from your vampiric
ancestors. It’s the difference between walking and crawling, it’s
preferable to walk around but if worse comes to shove if all you can do
is crawl around then all the power to you, red court forms for the win.
Like I was saying more familiar forms would then be true forms, your own
human form you are familiar with or like you just did a form of yourself
projected contingently to change age, hair colour, etc. Other humans
wouldn’t be too hard. Just don’t try for rocks and twigs yet unless as I
stated you have a preexisting understanding of what it is like to be a
rock or a twig. You’ll get better.”

I grabbed him hard for a long hug. A really long hug. This is such a
huge self-discovery I’m almost in tears. I can be the real human me now
and I know how to do it. I’ve waited a lifetime for the chance to be
human again and now I can be.

He took some references on vampires and magical use off his bookshelf.
He also grabbed a really old dusty reference on dæmon. He helped me
delve into some magic workings but after having read a few words and
seeing the energy spark and snap around me we decided to take our show
on the road again to the abandoned area of the camp. My magical ability
isn’t like a warlock, it’s not human, and it’s not fae. Spook said it
was like magic was attempting to cast unto itself and created a feedback
loop which had an infinite escalation pattern. Working with me we found
I can use magic if rather than focus on it I go zen and acknowledge my
awareness of my intentions and let it go. Keep ritual brief or use
simple somatic or verbal components, a wave of the hand or an enochian
word or sentance. The most important thing for me is distraction and not
focus. We found during the course of our investigations that when I was
working with him I created many magical effects without even having done
anything, or intended anything. I fart magic. I have no magical training
and know enough to be dangerous. To myself as much as others. I can cast
the same spellwork and I may or may not ever get the same result.
Testing for magical leakage as he called it further indicated I have a
perfect efficiency, and unlike human casters will have no issues with
technology whatsoever. What he taught me was enough to get by in the
presence of magic and have some self-control in it’s simple use without
causing an implosion of all that is which is what he was greatly worried
of.

He took the reference on dæmon and formulated a test, a residual test
for dæmonic energy. He brewed up a beaker of liquid and took a drop of
my blood, it was supposed to turn a colour depending on what type of
dæmonic energy was present. The dæmonic isn’t like demons that can
possess, the influence of dæmonic is very rare and often subtle but
infinitely powerful. As Spook said before every wizard and warlock he
knows avoids working with dæmon for the very reason that it is far too
dangerous. Like trying to lasso a speeding locomotive. The beaker
imploded on itself and fell as dust on the ground. Both Spook and I fell
backwards on the ground from both surprise and the shockwave. He
examined what was left.

He said, “I’ve never heard of anything like that. I won’t be able to
complete the test until I can find a way to resolve that problem.
According to the colour of the dust, pitch black, I think it might be
the presence of pure black magic. The dæmon who is the personification
of black magic is unknown to anyone colleagues. We have seen instances
where such an influence has been seen but it is a mystery what name we
could place on it. When we have seen it, well one instance was in the
mass presence of creatures of the night like vampires, in an unholy
place, a holocaust cemetary, which was the active site of truly vile
black magic. Just as a reference if that colour appeared in the liquid
in the beaker I would have said definitively that it is what the
powerful influence is on you. This colour with a deep blue hint is
water, the influence of Leviathan. This colour with a little grey
speckle is the influence of the death dæmonic of which it is said there
is more than one. Earth tone would be Belial, the earth energy. I guess
what I’m trying to say is with slight differences this could mean just
about anything and it’s made even worse because of the fact you are a
full blown vampire. You are exuding this energy already just by your
very nature. That said few vampires we’ve tested had even tested
positive for any direct influence of this type of dæmonic energy. I’ve
still never seen this test do that, implode into pieces. Maybe I’ll be
able to research a better test later on to find something out.

“For what it’s worth this is what I know about the dæmonic. Their
influence is actually inherent. The dæmonic is the created universe.
They each have their personalities though, being anthropomorphic
personifications. The universe as understood by many of my colleagues at
this point is multiversal. Each particular instance of a universe has
all it’s own parts, it’s own nevernever, it’s own gods even. What
doesn’t change is the white God who stands above all and in recent
research the dæmonic seem to exist in their own realm that intersects
the whole multiverse which means true omnipotence is applicable to not
only the one white God but also to dæmon.

“Coincidentally although I don’t get it correct all the time,
traditionally those who have dealt with the dæmonic have had trouble
keeping a separation in naming convention between the malevolent demon
and the benign dæmon. It originally came from the Greek definition and
carried down through the ages primarily through our hermetic research.
Much of what we know of dæmon came from our hermetic scholars and their
astral work. We have tried with keeping specific spellings, and by using
dæmon as a singular entity. Like saying: summon a demon, raise a demon,
raise demons, I am a demon, that is a demon all would refer to a
malevolent being. Saying: summon dæmon, raise dæmon, we are dæmon or I
am dæmon helps refer to the benign dæmon. Pronunciation of Daimon helps,
which is greek for divine power which seems suitable. Still questionable
though as we don’t see dæmon as having a direct influence on us as much
as an indirect influence through the gods or the mundane. Indeed it is
the gods that we expect to actually tap into the power of dæmon to
create influence in our world, like a god of water such as neptune would
be no god of anything without water. Water in turn would have no
influence on our world without neptune to create that influence. Imagine
the surprise our ancestors had when they realized that water indeed had
it’s own voice, personality, and name. That name is Leviathan.
Philosophically I’ve wondered if the demonification of dæmon pardon the
pun, was a way for the church to direct the flock away from the worldly
things toward heaven according to the doctrines of faith. There is
nothing more worldly than dæmon afterall. I digress though, you said you
had encounters with an entity that called itself Leviathan and named you
as his sister? Pray tell me more of that now that we have some time.”

So I retold the story from when I went to rescue Spook. He hung on every
word but admitted he didn’t know much about what it meant. He took notes
as I spoke and said he would consult with colleagues of his to see if he
can get any more knowledge. There aren’t any hermetic scholars around at
the moment and he doesn’t know how to contact any but the next time he
sees one he will parlay with them.

When I got home I experimented more with my shapeshifting. I can
shapeshift my clothes into my new forms which is something I was
starting to realize back on the road to the camp. Anything I wear can be
changed but like Spook said I have to be familiar with being what I
change to. I’m familiar with being clothed. I’m familiar with being
naked. If I hold a spoon I’ll be damned if I could do anything with it
as I’m not familiar with changing into or out of a spoon as I don’t know
what it’s like to be a spoon. Similarly I can’t just be clothes. I’ve
been naked and I’ve been clothed, but I’ve never just been a set of
clothes. I’ve been capable of mistform for a long time but that doesn’t
mean I can be smoke as I’ve never before known what it’s like to be
smoke.

I wandered off to spend time with my thralls as I need to recover the
energy I’ve lost with all the shapechanging I’ve been doing tonight. I
truly believe that one day, I will be the spoon.

Later that night after speaking with Laura I gathered the paperwork
together and headed back to the research area. I found Jane’s tent and
see her searching for some papers. I strode in burdened with inglorious
purpose. I placed the documents on her desk and stood there facing her.
She looked straight at me for a moment then walked from the corner of
the tent where she was searching. She looked down at the papers then
back to me. Her face reddening.

“What in the blue fuck is this about? Did you do just lift these off the
table when I wasn’t looking? Who sent you? Colonel Joachim? The general
is going to hear about this don’t fucking move bitch”, said Jane.

She started moving toward the door of the tent but didn’t any more than
turn around before I caught her by the waist. She said, “Get off m—”

I took her fast and pulled her close. My vampire vision came out and she
was hypnotized. I could see her aura and life’s blood, she was very
strong in spirit. She was self sacrificing and relentless. She is very
much the hero I hoped she would prove to be. I brought her lips to mine
for an intimate kiss.

This isn’t what a person might assume. Venom is quite effective if
deposited on the skin but works best if transferred through mucus
membranes. The mouth is the most generally accepted target. Other areas
vary from slightly more awkward to the kind of place that unless you are
really into that person it’s, well it’s just wrong.

It’s what has been called, “The Kiss” in the red court. We are actually
wired to take down our prey with a kiss, it’s in our genes, it excites
us.

The moment seemed like an hour, I could feel her succumb to the effect
in my arms and it was pulling me to the kill. I gently pulled away from
her. I really didn’t want to. Dear God that felt so good.

I said, “You were confused about something hun, where do you say I’m
from?”

She said, “The red court—”

She gasped and wiped her brow from arousal, then leaned gently on her
desk to help her keep on her feet. My mouth is drooling with hunger.

She said, “Why? How are you still here? What are you going to do? Do you
want to destroy the only chance these suffering people have to live? You
god-forsaken vindictive creatures your empire falls in tatters and you
take it out on the sick and helpless. We are going to kill whatever of
you are left I swear to God if I’m gone others will come. If you succeed
in killing our sick you can be sure we will give you a very painful
death.”

She sighed in excitement. I wiped drool from my chin.

I said, “I suppose that would be what you would think. That’s actually
not what I had in mi—”

She brushed her fingers through her hair, then threw her head back and
moaned. She looked at me submissively and gasped. She said, “Then what?
What could a red possibly want besides revenge? What are you scheming?
You damned creatures are always scheming. We are going to find out and
we will stop you. Kill me if you like I will never help you, before you
enthrall me I will kill myself you can never have me.”

She grabbed a letter opener from the desk, I caught her hand and it
dropped. She sighed. I looked at her like someone who hasn’t eaten for a
week sees a smoked ham.

She said, “Just take me. I can’t handle this any longer I need you to
take me. Just take me now.” I swooped in for a bit but tore myself away
just in time.

She said, “What’s the deal bitch? My blood not red enough for you?”

I said, “Shut up Jane, ok? Just shut up. I hit you too hard with the
venom although just enough given you have such fight. We are getting out
of here see? We have somewhere to go. Look at me and tell me if you
understand. We have to be quiet and not arouse others interest. Tell me
you understand you can be sure I will know if you lie.”

She said, “Not before you answer me this. I deserve to at least know
what your intent is in this.”

I said, “You said you need venom for the cure. I intend to get you the
venom you need to cure all these and any others in need. I’m the only
one who can do this for you and unless you chanced to meet another red
and didn’t tell me I think I may be your golden goose so don’t you dare
fuck this up for yourself.”

Her eyes were the size of golf balls, by her aura she seemed to accept
what I’m saying. She was swaying, holding onto the desk. The venom is
dangerously close to paralysing her, she looked intoxicated.

I said, “Do you have some booze?”

She said, “I think I’m under enough influence right now why would you
need booze?”

I said, “If there’s something here for God sake just get it.”

She went to the back of the tent and in a pile of papers just beside a
file cabinet she grabbed a mickey of whiskey in a paper bag.

I said, “Perfect, let’s go.”

We left the tent with her slumped over my shoulder half-paralysed with
venom. I sprinkled some fine single malt over us and took the bottle of
whiskey for a walk in plain sight. We passed people by as they shook
their head in understanding. Two people passing us said, “Yup. Told you.
She’s snapped. Working too hard for too long and I even heard the
general has shut her down and reassigned her. Yup, that’s what Dave told
me yesterday. Seen it coming from afar.”

So we stumbled and dragged ourselves to the back quarter of the
encampment close to the embankment. The sentries in this area are placed
further up the embankment and all that’s here are supplies, having
already passed the ammunition tents. We found one that looks like it
hasn’t been touched in months. Inside it’s still dry and there is metal
shelving holding mostly used clothing, both civilian and military. I
found a pile of exercise mats in the corner and took some to put Jane
down on.

She said, “So what’s the deal, you going to camp out in this filthy
place for me to milk venom? I can do better for you than this shithole
nobody knows what you are and I’m not going to tell anyone. You’re
helping me help thousands who can’t help themselves.”

I said, “I really can’t do that. The general is going to search for me
if I go missing. He may not keep me in the encampment and eventually
ship me out which I know for a fact he is going to do soon, he has
already given me orders. I’m a journalist and need to go north
eventually to find help and support among those who have it. Besides
whatever arrangement you can make is eventually going to be found out
anyway and sure as shit the fellowship is going to kill any red they
find, probably also those who conspire with them most notably you in
this case. Your patients lose not only hope but their most outstanding
doctor. Using me to harvest venom is a losing proposition.”

She looked at me, “You deceived me, I believed you. Why did I believe
you? Now you have me here, I’m such a fool. You intended to kill me here
to hide the evidence and use the drunken stagger from earlier tonight to
make it think it was something I did in my drunken state. Fine go ahead
and kill me, give me more venom and make me like it more. Bitch.”

I said, “Oh no, I told no word of a lie, I do intend you will get the
venom you need. Believe every word I told you. Just not from me”

She said, “You aren’t making sense, if you won’t give venom then who—”

I said, “You.”

At that last word I leapt like a tiger. I was on top of her in a split
second and drowned her in a deep kiss. Her eyes went as deep as the
ocean as waves of venom flowed through her.

She said, “No, please, no.” and gasped.

She threw her head back from pleasure and she said, “Yes, Please. Yes”

I dove into her neck and fresh beautiful blood poured into me, my whole
body quivered in a new way in response to my intent. Her body became
cold and her eyes dead as glass. I shifted to my own true form, the bird
form, and held her in my arms. She is quite dead. Inside my blood meal
is stirring. I feel myself beginning to heave. My body is incubating my
seed into my bloodmeal. The excitement is building in me as the moment
comes. I lock my lips with hers and deliver our life back to her. I see
her eyes open pure black. I wrapped my wings around her and held her
tight. My seed is consuming her etheric body and looking down on her
aura I can see that part of her die and the vampire take it’s place. On
the completion of the infection she releases a hiss for the first time.
My first baby girl as a vampire. What will she be like? She didn’t
regain consciousness for an hour while I rocked her, or at least
functioning. She laid there still, her eyes large and black and
unblinking. Honestly, I thought my firstborn turned out a bit wrong
until she spoke.

She said, “Hungry. Want food.”

I said, “I don’t think you need food dear. I’ll be here until you gain
your senses and can decide that for yourself.”

She sniffed the air and looked around like an animal, “Smells good, out
there, there.” and she pointed to the main area of the encampment.

I said, “I know dear. It smells good.”

I sang a lullaby to try to take her mind off her hunger. After a while
she said, “Where am I?”

I said, “Jane? Can you hear me?”

She said, “Who, who are you? Where am I?”

I said, “Jane my name is Susan, we are in a supplies tent at the back of
the encampment.”

She said, “Why? What am I doing out here? What’s wrong with my eyes
things look funny.”

I said, “Stay with me a while. I’ll look after you just relax Jane while
things start to come together.”

She said, “I feel a hunger, I’ve felt this before not so long ago.
Something’s wrong. Something’s terribly wrong.”

I said, “It’s all wrong Jane, there ain’t nothing right here.”

She said, “That’s damn straight. I’ll take you up on it, I’ll rest here
a while.”

![image](Images/hrule.png)

She said, “Bloodlust? Oh Christ I remember, you fucking whore goddammit
you fucking turned me you fuck—”

She looked up at me, she said, “Oh.”

I said, “Yeah, oh.” as I gave my wings a shake and tucked them behind.

She said, “What team am I playing for now? What’s the color?”

I told her of the events so far from until now.

She said, “Sounds like we used to be the red court.”

I said, “Don’t even say that. We have some red court genes.”

She said, “I like that better. Still have the half turned stage as well,
you left me half-turned.”

I said, “I left it your choice what path you wanted to take from here. I
feel it’s your right to choose.”

She said, “You’re right, and you took that away when you didn’t explain
what you had in mind. I don’t want to be back in the position of
infected. No fellowship member would.”

I said, “If I did you wouldn’t have gone through with it, I know that.”

She said, “You’re right. We might have still found venom at some old
encampment. Now it doesn’t matter what’s done is done. I understand your
reasons. I want you to stay away from me. When you leave this place
don’t come back I don’t want to see or hear from you again.”

At that she left. I hope this was the right choice; that I should turn
her; that it was her who should be turned first; That she should have
been turned at all. May God have mercy on us all if I have chosen
wrongly.

San Jose
========

’m making my way back in the morning to the tent I was sharing with my
thralls. I didn’t see any sign of Jane, nor did I seek her out.

The general was waiting for me.

He said, “The time has come for you to head north. We have a huey on the
helipad and our teams patrolling north are in place now. Things are
clear for the trip now but it has to happen now. You have a radio to
call extraction among the gear that we placed in the chopper. You’re
going in alone, move your ass.”

I didn’t have much more time than to say be safe to my thralls. I hope
I’m not going to be too long I don’t want them to get sick again.

Once I climbed into my chopper I had a vision of a small tent. A persons
quarters, dresser, clothes, cooking area. It was so clear it was like I
was there. Things were tossed about the tent. In my hand was a tissue. I
am aware of where I am but also aware of this other location and it
feels I’m here too. My eyes are full of tears. I’m not controlling my
body in this other location, or it doesn’t seem so, but I rise from
sitting on a bed and see my reflection in the mirror. It’s Jane. She is
suffering a lot of sorrow from her change. I tried to will her positive
juju as they say, project the love I have for her as my firstborn. I see
her looking around as if startled by something then the vision fades. I
wonder what that was?

There is a sargeant flying with me that gives me a brief on the
situation north. It’s a report of a zombie outbreak. It’s in an
industrial area noone is going through at night anymore, even by car.
Nobody seems to be infected by these creatures (lucky bastards) but the
unfortunate souls that meet them are torn to shreds. Like need dental
records for ID kind of torn up. The police are investigating but the
department is small and overwhelmed, the case is just not moving
anywhere and the supernatural overtones makes it even worse for
priority. It’s been going on a year and the community has nowhere to
turn.

![image](Images/hrule.png)

We touch down and I’m sent to a Catholic parish, whose pastor has agreed
to house me.

I was scared to death about crossing the threshold. I might not be able
to and it would be hard to explain why. Everyone I’m pretty sure knows
about the destruction of the red court by now the fireworks were seen
all over this part of the world maybe farther.

I said, “Umm, I haven’t been in a church in a long time father. I’m a
little afraid of stepping in that doorway. There’s a darkness on me.”

He said, “It will be okay my child, the Lord our God is merciful to all
sinners, he longs to bring you into his house.”

I said, “Maybe, but there are some reborn of darkness, the children of
the night, who can’t pass that door. What’s to say my dark heart is any
different?”

He said, “I am gifted by our Lord that I can sense a great darkness like
that and I do not see it in you, and how could that manner of darkness
be in you my child? No living person could possibly have a darkness so
great as to one born of evil. Be at peace child it is safe to enter into
this house of our Lord.”

I took his word that he has a sense of the dark supernatural, and if I’m
not setting off his spidey sense then maybe this threshold will accept
me too.

I said, “I will try father but if my phobia gets the best of me we may
have to make different arrangements for a place to stay.”

I think that is the perfect excuse, well maybe a little strange but
relying on a short-circuit in the brain to me seems a no-brainer. I
slowly move one foot toward the threshold and felt a heat. A lot of
heat. I looked at my foot and it was red. Otherwise it was okay. I laced
up my shoe again and inched closer. Still the heat, like a shower that
had only the hot water coming out. In the end I decided to take the
plunge and walked straight in quickly and found once I was past the
threshold that scalding hot water feeling slowly receded like someone
turned on the cold water in that shower. I was quite red and the sweat
was pouring off me but I was able to cross into the threshold of the
church and live. It’s rather amazing I wasn’t repelled back due to my
red court bloodline. Well I’m glad I’m not so limited seeing as I can
otherwise walk around in the day and live a fairly normal life as humans
would see it. Well, as I see it too I feel half human a lot of the time.
The way I completed my turning is a real clusterfuck.

Father said, “Oh my dear child look at you. Here let me wipe off that
sweat, I have some cool water over here let me take a cloth and cool you
down a bit”

As soon as the water touched my forehead it felt like it was boiling
water. I grabbed fathers hand and moved it way gently but in record time
before the effect was obvious. Again a good thing my forehead didn’t go
up in smoke and flame. I looked over and found father dipped the cloth
in a font. Well that answers that question.

I said, “No no father that’s room temperature. If it’s cool water you
want go run a faucet for a while and get it cold.”

I’m clenching my teeth

He said, “I swear it looks like the font water scalded you. It’s rather
singular. Okay Susan I’ll go run some tapwater.”

He said his name is father Gomez. He is going to keep me with him in the
rectory as he is a bit worried someone might lay a hand on me in this
fairly rough neighbourhood. I’m worried I might lay my own hand too
heavily on some poor thug so I too see the wisdom in being in a safe
place. Father asked if we are under hire by Rome.

He asked, “You want to know more about the zombie trouble.”

I said, “You read my mind I certainly do.”

So from what was said they seem to be concentrated in particular around
a warehouse marked as being owned by ACME inc. Well hell I thought that
was only from looney tunes I didn’t think it was an actual company.
Anyway whether that was the actual owner anymore is yet to be known. He
showed me on the map that location and the locations of sightings and
bodies. About a dozen all in all. I made light of the shameful fact this
is a low priority for police and father made a sorrowful pose.

First stop town records. Lets see who owns that warehouse. Now if anyone
has ever been to San Jose it is one of the most backward national
capitals I know of. No transit system in place and the streets have no
names. I haven’t spent a lot of time here so other than taking flight to
see where I’m going I had to accept A.J. along with me, who was father
Gomez’s suggestion as a guide. A.J. lived here all his life and works as
a taxi driver. We travelled when he was off shift.

So it looks like the warehouse was owned by a company called ACME boot.
Checking the microfiche around the time of purchase in the late 1950’s
to early ’60s the company was heavily promoting the first western boot
store in central America. It never got any traction, was repurchased by
a real estate company for lease or resale but fell to the bank in
repossession. Nothing since. So dead end nobody has really owned that
building since the 60’s. I need to do some on site investigating. If I
can find a safe spot a stakeout would be best. Keep quiet, close this
case.

I see Jane again. I am her standing over her research desk with an empty
mickey of whiskey in front of her. I hear her say, “I can’t even get
drunk.” she sits in her chair at her desk staring at the empty bottle.
Then the vision fades.

I get A.J. to show me the route to that warehouse and drive me around it
a little bit. It’s got the crap beat out of it from years of not being
used. The warehousing around it is not faring any better. It’s the
middle of the day so we decide to drive up. There are tire marks coming
from the locked gate, looks like trucks. There is an old rusty chain and
padlock on the ground cut off with bolt cutters. Somebody replaced the
chain. The old padlock didn’t seem in too bad shape so it seems to me
someone either lost the key or just never had it to start with. I think
we are dealing with trespassing unless the bank is doing something here.
I continue to walk casually to the warehouse, and pass into it is
gaseous form. I seriously doubt the bank has been anywhere near this
place looks like it’s ownership documents went through a shredder.
Inside looks like a Freddy Krueger film. There is blood everywhere,
small body parts, deep scratches in the floors and walls. Some really
solid looking steel tanks have deep indents in the forms of fists and
steel girders have chunks bitten off them like they were taffy. Jesus,
what the hell is going on in here? I look up and see an opening in the
roof near a platform, maybe once used to oversee plant operations. I see
signs where there has been people climbing up to this outpost recently,
and often. Someone dropped a pen here, Monsantus Genetic Engineering
LLC. MGEL for short I guess. Fascinating. There is some paperwork left
behind also, it definitely looks like an engineers handiwork I can’t
make most of it out. What I can pick out are words like specimens,
candidates, fit for deployment, unfit, weak. I just get the sense they
are up to no good. I leap down the 50 feet and land quiet and graceful
as a cat. I hear a crash outside. I find some urban camo bdu and threw
it on, and hit the floor with a KA-BAR in my teeth. Moving silently from
stair to tank to drum I get to the nearest exit to where I heard the
crash. I peer quickly and nobody. Sticking to the wall like I was part
of it I move around the corner to see a housecat in a garbage pail.
“reowww” and it was gone. Handpalm. Good enough then. A.J. takes me back
to the rectory.

Great, so rather than answer questions I only have more questions.

Hope lost, I need to followup now on finding the right needle in a pile
of needles.

So it’s really not much good yet staking out the location the research
comes first. If I stake it out too soon they may spook and take off to
some location I don’t know about. We have a company name, and some
engineering documents. Let’s start with the company first.

That night I relaxed for supper and tune in my radio. I updated my
handler at the encampment and he thanked me for my work. That evening I
borrowed fathers computer and booted tails. Let’s see who this MGEL
company is.

I found it. A biological engineering company working in the medical
research field. Again fascinating. Was the mess in the warehouse
something about medical waste or, sweet mercy, failed human experiments?
It’s got to be something that needed to take place in some remote
warehouse so they are definitely trying to hide something. As if I
didn’t already know that. I also see that they have a research location
downtown so that looks like a good place to hang out. I continued
looking into the location but to no avail. So it looks like I’m going to
be making another trip. Infiltration would be the best way. It was
practically a way of life in the Fellowship. Get in and get out without
notice. Get the job done silently and flawlessly.

Just as I intended I go to the location and find the entrance has a
guard and is using a biometric entry system. The employees are the usual
nerds with pocket protectors. I have a camera in some clothes on the
table to snap shots then bluetoothing them to the tablet. Using my
superhuman ears I’m picking up names and information of employees as
they enter and talk with the guard. I grab guards fingerprint pattern
from a book, the sentry desk, and even the biometric scanner itself. It
just takes time, the guards can’t stay their post indefinately nature
will call at some point and that’s when my opportunity presents itself.
I keep it up for a week and get quite a bit of intel, names, weekend
activities, relationships, shift patterns, work area. Thank God for the
outgoing and chatty guard he almost did the work for me.

I studied the available data of the employees. Now how to get in. I need
to bring a laptop to gather network info once I’m inside.

I have a good profile of the guard. The night guard is likely best. The
one named Peter is scheduled off Monday and Thursday the poor bastard. I
wait around until the guard goes for a piss and shapeshift into him.
Then I use the biometric samples I got earlier and I’m in. Who is going
to suspect the guard of a security breach.

I had a vision of Jane. She is working with one of the patients. She is
trying to insert an IV. Despite the patient being strapped down the
needle lacerated the patients neck. I feel intense hunger and see her
moving to take the man, then I see she is running as fast as she can out
of the tent. Then the vision fades.

The day came and I was nervous as all hell. The moment came and I lucked
out, Margo arrived while I posed as guard.

“Evening Margo how’s Sparky is he feeling better?”, sparky is her
pomeranian.

“Much better yes, he must have been eating something he shouldn’t have
thanks for asking”

“Oh shit I left my keyring inside.” I slip behind her.

“Jesus Larry, Jacob will have your ass for that.”

“Who’s gonna take it Marg, like really?”

“Jacob, so he can shove them up your ass”

“point taken.”

I enter and quickly assess the area I entered. A long hallway ahead and
a small alcove immediately to the right for a security desk. I dive for
the alcove and switch to Peter under the desk. I see a camera at the
door and I’m hoping the exact coming and going of employees isn’t
tracked with it because security will be confused as hell.

So now I’m Peter the guard. Time to wander.

Familiar faces in the labs. I’ve seen them enter and exit many times
before at the front entrance. six labs on the left and a cafeteria to
the right. Otherwise just one big long hall. Making note of who is in
the labs for my next incursion. An elevator at the end of the hall. The
second floor is empty, 9 to 5 people work here presumably. Assigned
cubicles, I make note of the names the best I can. Nothing extraordinary
here except computer access in privacy in the evening so bonus. I check
out a workstation. Bios is locked and wont boot from cd. I expected that
but it’s still annoying. I’ll need the laptop to clone the mac of the
nic and hook up directly for a network mapping and recon of the network.
That said I wonder where the IT offices are anyway?

Up to the third floor. Executive suites. Offices and conference rooms,
secretarial pools where there are a couple people still working. At last
the IT room. If I can get access to this area I’m in the game. Hmm,
let’s see. I try transitioning to the vampiric mist since there is
nobody around and I get through the door no issue. Oh my God, morons. No
supernatural shielding on the door and system passwords written down on
all the equipment. Multiple Vpn tunnels for different department,
connection information on a corkboard. A complete network map also. Good
enough for now, I write it all down and take pictures then smoke my way
out the door. Still nobody around. As i head toward the elevator the
door opens, and I dive behind a wall. I go gaseous but there is
anti-supernatural shielding in place. Oops. They would see my mist form,
too far away to do a spidey thing and hang from the ceiling. I don’t
know enough about Peter to know if he is supposed to be on this floor.
The guard! Why wouldn’t a guard wander a facility if they think
something isn’t right.

“Hi Larry what are you up here for?”

“Somebody said they seen someone up here but I don’t remember letting
anyone in with access to this floor.”

“Shit. Maybe I’ll grab that paperwork another night.”

“Could have been someone slipped in while I made water”

“Yeah could be, Or it could be Samantha she is always forgetting
something. Most of these guys come in at the corporate entrance opposite
Mindy’s cafe”

“Yeah but not at 11 oclock at night.”

“Agreed. Well good Larry stay safe.”

“Much as I can take care.”

I wait a few minutes and head for the elevator, switch back to Peter in
the elevator and back out past Larry to the outside of the complex then
to the public john. Fuck. Good job on faultless infiltration Susan.
Every little failure like that could spell disaster. I’ve overestimated
my abilities, no matter what power I may have I can’t avoid chance. I
completely failed to get the paperwork, I didn’t gather the info I
needed so much.

Note to self, don’t take chances like that. I’m still Susan, whatever I
may be I’m not all that yet if ever I will be.

I shapeshift back to myself and head off an emergency while I’m there.

Well, I may be able to make an attack from outside to gather evidence.
Then also onsite photographic evidence at the warehouse I want to see
the horrors that are unleashed out there.

Hmm, how to do this. I don’t have to be onsite but I need to check the
different components of their network to make sure I don’t get detected.
I have all my notes and references from back during the black hat work.
I think top priority as always is to avoid detection.

Best course of action is likely to create a GRE tunnel from the internet
gateway server and I can redirect traffic through a box I control. Kind
of a man in the middle. I probably wont get all of the internal traffic
but if I get traffic to and from their headquarters that is likely going
to be the most likely slam dunk anyway. I’ll need to figure out where to
find a location that has enough bandwidth to handle their traffic in and
out reasonably, if I can find out how big a pipe ie. how fast their
connection is, I can judge what I need on this end to make thing more
transparent. Thinking about it I may be able to configure one or more of
their internal routers to push all traffic to the internet gateway, then
I could actually capture the internal communications. Hell if their
routers are sophisticated enough I might be able to redirect only the
E-Mail from the internal routers to the internet gateway to save on
traffic. That might make my head explode though I need to check through
these books to see if I have enough step by steps to do what I want to
do already.

I studied most of the day to see what I can accomplish. The GRE tunnel
is doable. Might be able to do more like redirect only E-Mail traffic
through the tunnel then there would likely be nearly negligible traffic
which would make things easier from this end, I won’t need much
bandwidth for the redirection. Configuring internal routers? I haven’t a
frickin clue and no documentation on it so skip that.

Good then, I don’t want to put father in a pickle so I’ll do my snooping
of the network at the little library on the next block assuming it has
internet of some kind. My laptop is installed with Kali linux so I am
about ready to go. I’ll just put the laptop on the huge stack of books
in the old rucksack and over I go. Nice thing is having a stack of books
beside you in a library makes more sense than a hotel, coffee bar, or
wherever else one may go.

Now the first thing is to find a way in. The access is likely blocked
from the outside via IP. I can’t defeat that but looking at the map
there is a VPN server on the same subnet as the main server farm. That
is likely used for outside administration. That is likely the best entry
point to gain access to the network. I can then setup the tunnel on the
internet facing router and gather the data. That should complete the
better part of my work I just need to run scripts on the packet data.

So time to head out to the library. I’ve been studying maps of the city
so I’m getting more of a sense of where things are now so I’m starting
to travel some on my own.

Time to Rock. Get some items for pistol smuggling. Swing by the sporting
goods store for firearms cleaning supplies, ammo and the like, then off
to the library with a stack of hacking manuals. It seems so wrong. Maybe
a hoodie and gangsta pants would make it right. Need a pocket protector
for the hoodie to make the look complete.

OK let get to work redirecting their E-Mail. Turn on the laptop and lets
go for a spin with wireless.

Checking the network map I scribbled down, admin.mgel.us good, now lets
skip a risky port scan and just go with what we got here. a VPN tunnel
is setup for remote administration on this box. Logged in perfectly.
Debian linux system they are connecting using SSH, which is expected
nowadays. Lets run some traces to check latency on the network.\

First to check the path from here to that office.

    #traceroute admin.mgel.us

All appears quite normal Latency is a good judge of health and the
connection speed should be good too. At least until we know otherwise.
Lets try the VPN and hope to hell the passwords I have actually work.
Add a system connection name. Call it ruffles. Now please realize I did
my research and I’m following steps from a couple books and more than a
couple websites. I ain’t no hacker but I know enough by experience to
find what I need and run like hell if I fuck up. Which happens more
often than I dare to admit.

    password-flags=0
    [vpn-secrets]
    password=booyukker

Moment of truth let’s connect this thing.

    sudo nmcli con up "ruffles"
    Connection successfully activated (D-B

Oh sweeeet! The password information works! I’m right where I want to be
now. Let’s try root access. Got that password too. The thing with being
able to log into a server with root is you have absolute control over
that server. I mean absolute control. I’ll have to use this guy
mandeville’s account. direct connection to root remotely is pretty much
always blocked.

    $ ssh mandeville@admin.mgel.us
    mandeville@admin.mgel.us's password: 
    NetBSD 7.0.1_PATCH (GENERIC.2016072205

    % su root
    Password:
    # 

Not like in the movies it’s really boring actually, except for the
likely chance of getting caught. No power of mine makes that any less
likely. Then there’s prison time, or torture, or worse. These seem
likely nasty motherfuckers, I would say losing toenails is high up on
the list of likelyhoods. If what I’ve seen so far It’ all but guaranteed
they would have deathstone ordinance.

That “su” command escalated me to root from the mandeville account.
Mission accomplished. Now I need to check if I can access the internet
firewall. The redirection will need to happen there. Secureshell
otherwise known as SSH is the one and only way to connect for most
administrative work on servers today. So lets give it the old college
try. I only have a password listed so it seems like they got some
dumbass consumer router on point. These guys are awful

    ssh root@gateway.mgel.us
    root@gateway.mgel.us's password: 
    Permission denied, please try again.
    root@gateway.mgel.us's password: 
    Permission denied, please try again.
    root@gateway.mgel.us's password: 
    Permission denied (publickey,password,

Well that was strike one. I don’t know what the hell that box is, it’s
not on the network map. OK think Susan think, what did we use back in
the day. Port scanner, sticky note here, nmap! right, It can read
digital signatures for an idea of what this thing is. OK let’s give it a
whirl.

    # nmap -O -v gateway.mgel.us

I don’t like port scanning tools, too easy to trigger a red alarm. I was
actually very lucky the administrative machine had it installed.
Normally there aren’t any “offensive” tools resident on network servers.
I wonder what the deal is here? I need to tread carefully.

What do we got? a FreeBSD box. This place is a BSD shop for sure. I have
a password but it isn’t working. Not a root password. The www port is
open so there’s a web page there. Let’s see if we can surf the gateway.

Ohhh. The browser opened a pfsense administration page. Refer to sticky
note time. Default username is admin. Perhaps they only changed the
password?

Yup, logged right in. OK now I know what I’m dealing with. Time to break
away from this before I fuck something up and get caught. I need to
create a rule to use in order to redirect traffic now that I know what
I’m dealing with. So I grab the Kali CD out and tuck in a hidden pocket.
Let the laptop boot windows and flip it closed. I say the laptop runs
kali linux because for all intents and purposes it does but windows is
still on the computer with ditzy apps and official looking business
documents. Basically to cover up any shady work I’ve been up to and stay
out of trouble.

Bloody hell, just like from the US Marines that just burst through the
door. What the hell are US Marines doing in the ghetto?

“Everyone will submit to search, any who do not submit will be taken
into marine custody for questioning. We will start with you.”

The master sergeant proceeded to deploy his men in tactical positions
when shortly two more men entered. The salutes were immediate and
powerful.

“General Lancaster! Sir! Area is secure to proceed with investigation
Sir!”

Oh my God, what the hell is a marine general doing in a ghetto! Christ
Susan if you don’t have a story here! Something is up, and unless angels
fly out of Obama’s ass this is hitting the front page of any paper! So
the search proceeded specifically for electronic equipment. The general
had with him an officer who seemed to be well trained in electronic
warfare. Looks like perhaps black hat shit. One of the soldiers snatched
my laptop rather forcefully and the black hat examined it fully. I was
sweating bullets. Not literally thank God given the company I’m keeping
at the moment but nonetheless I hoped I had enough training to not leave
enough of a trace.

“This thing is clear general, this couldn’t have generated the
connections. Nothing in the logs, hardware MAC is incorrect and it looks
like it was setup by a homemaker all cheesy games and recipe lists.”

The general responded, “Goddamned MGEL admins, fricking off for a coffee
and refuse to register out. We go out chasing some Goddamned shade
midafternoon just to find he was doing his shit on a Goddamned park
bench outside the motherfucking target address. Jesus fucking Christ
pack it in boys we’re going back to assignment.”

Yet again Susan you did a right fine job. Go back to school. I’m rustier
than a sewer pipe. I’m taking chances not only with my assignment but
with my life. Again I performed an infiltration and only succeeded. I
neither got anything setup nor did I get any hard evidence of anything.
Just passwords. Just another chance to get caught from logging in again.
What is the chance of logging in twice safely when the first time I
tripped an alarm? Better think this through better next time.

The military has their way with words. Anyway perhaps it’s time to get a
hold of my teacher and see if he can draw up some rules for me. I could
probably do it but I’m getting a headache just thinking about it. Mercy.

I head back to the rectory and lay down for a bit. Fascinating how
things change. The next course of action I’m thinking of may be a bit
dangerous. There are marines here and I need to find out more about
that. Maybe the first thing is to find them physically. What is their
assignment? I feel like I should do a real stakeout of the warehouse
now, dollars to doughnuts that’s where the marines are going to be when
things go down out there. I’ll send out the E-Mail request to my buddy
first. If I don’t do a stakeout now I don’t see where it would be easy
for me to sort the captured data, I wouldn’t have a point of reference
to look for. Text queries makes things quick folks, either by the grep
command or a more sophisticated keyword search if you have the right
words it’s easier to pull better stuff out of the muck. I think I will
have that bath. I can’t stop thinking about it.

I start getting ready. I shape shift into marine fatigues with full
webbing and ruck and strap on a glock. I shape shift a KA-BAR under the
other arm. Various little supplies I put in the webbing and make it real
and ready for an infiltration. I include among other things my phone for
photographic media and recording and a really boring brown colour trench
coat to conceal the warrior underneath.

I see a vision of Jane, she is milking her venom into a beaker. She
turns around quickly and the general is entering the tent. He is very
joyous speaks for a bit then leaves. Jane leaves the tent and enters the
nearest patient tent. It housed a few hundred sick. a quarter were
healthy already the rest were very much improved. She said, “If you’re
listening Susan, and I hope you are, you were right. It had to be me. As
soon as my work started producing results, I told the general I didn’t
need the venom afterall. The general had me quarantined in the patient
tent in the presumption I was in league with some remaining red court
contingent. He never considered I produced my own venom now. He was
satisfied then that I was operating without the venom after a time of
quarantine. Of course he gave me a verbal beating about all the time I
could have spent finding a way without the venom. The killing would have
started all over again if I failed to continue consistent results.”

I decide the best course of action would be to try to stake out or
infiltrate the warehouse one more time. Last time it was abandoned so it
seems straight forward if there is activity I stake it out if there is
not then it seems reasonable noones home I’ll infiltrate. I damn well am
going to get it right this time, in and out without a trace, quiet as a
mouse.

So I start to walk over to the warehouse. Nobody really pays me much
attention even though I look like I must be hot. Really though I soak
the heat right in. I seem to be a cold blooded creature I really enjoy
hot and humid weather. It’s approaching evening now when I get there. I
look and listen and there is nobody here. Unless they’re dead. In which
case they won’t notice me anyway. I would assume. I climb to the roof,
using the ladder outside the building this time. I put away the cloak,
finish my dress with things like putting on the boonie and finishing
face paint as well as tying back my hair. I go over to the front edge of
the roof and use my supernatural vision to see in the far distance to be
able to see the truck assuming it’s coming tonight.

Sometime after midnight I see the lights of a military truck roll in. A
fair size canvas top likely a couple long rows of benches inside. It
stops snug to the buildings main door. I hear the sound of men exiting,
a couple dozen I would say. I pick up pieces of conversation inside as I
sit on the edge of the roof. Test subjects, ensuring their protective
devices are functional. They are taking their “places” and the subjects
are released. I hear hissing from below. Oh God tell me it isn’t what I
think. I hear commands going down to the creatures line up, spread out,
take position, fight, relent, and so on. They are taking orders like
soldiers and being commanded to fight. I get to the trapdoor and use my
scope to look down. I am just over the top catwalk and see some men
including the general stationed in the control booth closest to the top
of the structure. There are actually white coated scientists making
notes up there with MGEL insignia on their coats. I look below and see
the ugliest test subjects I have ever seen, black court vampires! What
in the fricking hell are these people doing? Are they completely mad!

Extraordinarily enough the vampires are obedient. They are taking orders
and fighting. There were 2 who broke free but the soldiers present took
them down with deathstone weapons. The little bloodsuckers didn’t have a
chance. Maybe that’s why they obey like they do. If they all united
together though they could be able to break free. Why haven’t they
munched the other soldiers? There’s what I see, what I hear, smells like
putrification but also of garlic. Taking a closer look there is
something hanging from the soldiers necks, and I see the item exposed on
one soldier. They wear garlic. Probably other items as well so they are
protected.

“How many of the subjects have been able to independently carry out
orders?”

“We have released 6 subjects in the last 2 weeks general, 4 have
returned and we have confirmed have met their objective. The two
remaining have not returned.”

“We need to carry back at least a 95 percent conformance ratio so we
need to keep working. The DNA injections progressing well?”

“Satisfactorily sir. Ever since we started with the cream based
application and applied the solar radiation the changes seem to be
taking place. Some of the expected human characteristics in personality
seem apparent allowing more control and more self discipline.”

“How much longer?”

“Months, on the outside, assuming progress continues at the current
rate.”

“That’s excellent. The perfect super soldier. Scary as hell, tough, fast
and strong. Able to raise dying enemies to fight alongside them.
Incredible.”

My stomach turned. I’ve heard of monstrous experiments to create new and
terrible weapons and even supersoldiers, but someone really didn’t think
this one through. Vampires are organized you fools! Flooded with
intrigue and backstabbing yes but ultimately united for the sake of
self-preservation at the very least. They could bring a war. Humans have
no chance in such a war. Vampires are higher up the food chain.

As I pondered the ways of idiocy below I seen the creatures stop what
they were doing. The were sniffing the air. Like dogs. Some of them
climbed the walls ten feet sniffing. They all started orienting their
eyes, and eye sockets as it were, directly at this hatch and let out a
hiss. Oh hell I’m in some trouble, mmhmm some trouble yep. They lit a
straight line directly for me. Soldiers opened fire the general and all
the softie scientists hit the floor. The general opened fire with a
pistol right through the window of the control booth. The creatures
couldn’t have cared less they smelled me without the lovely aroma of
garlic. Time to practise the art of pulling punches I guess.

I did a tuck and roll out of the way of the hatch and at least a dozen
black court vampires sprang out of it with a united hungry hiss. I heard
below the call for all soldiers to hit the roof and make the attack. The
test subjects are not to escape. The first three i avoid with a leap to
the left and barrel roll. Two more come to the left i pull up hard on my
hands and use the momentum from the roll to land a solid boot to the two
knocking them down. I follow through punching through one of the next
two. Grabbing my KA-BAR i come behind another and remove a head. One
down. Four are advancing i holster the KA-BAR, then cartwheel back onto
one knee and open fire with my glock those four go down. I leap high and
force both steel toed combat boots down hard on two of the four
destroying skulls. Three down.

The general and soldiers arrive as a trickle through the hatch on the
roof, and the general has his holy shit face on. The soldiers are going
to fire but he yells, “hold fire you morons, there’s a soldier on the
roof. You goddamned ballerinas take notes because that’s how it’s
fricking done right there!”

The two remaining each grab an arm i leap my body behind them and crack
their skulls together and they let go. I unsheathe my ka-bar and make a
vicious swing. Off goes a head. Now 4 down. They rush in I tuck and roll
knocking over one and plant the ka-bar through it’s skull. 5 down and 7
left. They pile on me and I become a chew toy. Shit.

The general shouts, “fuck, she’s gone. Hell of a soldier. Ready weapons
to fire!”

I burst straight up through the pile and blast three rounds straight
down. 2 exploding skulls, 2 more down.

The general shouts, “hold fire! Jesus Christ who is this? Who is this
soldier?”

The soldiers shout in unison, “Hoo Rah!”

The third I crush under my boot 1 down 4 to go. Tuck and roll knock one
down, grab my KA-BAR then plant my feet and reverse momentum. Launch at
one and remove it’s head. I land and turn ready to roll to the side but
one decides to rush in and meet my KA-BAR, so off goes another head and
2 to go. Both rush in i leap forward and clothesline both to the ground.
I tuck and roll come up with the glock and shatter a skull. The
remainder made it to the 3dge of the roof in time and jumped. Somehow it
landed in one piece. The soldier open fire on it but it leaped the fence
and was gone.

I’m a moron. This happened twice now. A near miss and now I’m caught red
handed. Even if I do worm my way out of this I’m going to be marked. It
is unlikely I’ll be able to finish this mission I’m a made woman. I
can’t pretent to be a soldier to complete my mission I will without a
doubt be found out and it will be a world of pain for me. If I sneak
away I know by my track record I won’t be able to finish this mission
without accepting the same fate. I’ll be tortured and likely killed. I
don’t even know what my death may do, there is so much mystery about me,
the may be greater harm to the world at large that I can’t forsee. I
just hope I haven’t started any wars today.

The best I can do at this point is gather everything I can as fast as I
can and getting the fuck out, hoping I haven’t pissed in anyone’s corn
flakes. I’ve caused enough shit. Whatever evidence I’ve got I’ll use and
hope it’s enough, I’ll call in the extraction right away and fly this
place before I end up pissing anyone off.

The general walked up, “That was some bit of fighting soldier. I don’t
remember seeing you before you got ID?”

I check my pockets in a fake attempt to find ID, then I point to the
pile of dead vampires, “on it’s way to hell?”.

The general responds, “well shit so it is, fuck it I seem to suddenly be
getting my memory back I remember you just fine. Come on down have some
whiskey on me. Men stand down lets get back to it.”

I descend and notice a shit ton of juicy paperwork waiting for a pocket
or a photo. Checking down below there seems not to be any more
‘subjects’ to work with. I seem to have destroyed them all. Aw shucks.

The general states, “I’m going to go down and help the boys clean up
this mess. Well frick I wish I knew what the hell might have caused this
shit.” He gives me a devilish smile.

So I’m left with a couple drunk scientists who tried to use liquid
courage to bolster themselves earlier. Easy as pie my phone works so i
snap some verifiable media with the camerav app, and other papers i just
pocket. The scientists are too drunk to know. Then i go down and help
clean up. The whole time snapping photos where i can. When it’s time to
go everyone boards the truck except me who holds on to the
undercarriage. Down the road i tuck and roll out of the carriage and
into an alley. I move into the rear area of a shop with spare garbage
cans and a huge propane tank and take a breather. I meditate a couple
hours then get up and make my way towards the parking lot to try and
make sure the troop truck doesn’t double back to find me.

I had another vision of Jane, I seen Jill and my thralls with her.

Jane said, “Thank you all so much, it’s getting out of control. I can’t
get the warlock tattoo to control my hunger. If I asked I would get
killed off as the only red left. I needed help.”

Jill said, “Susan is beloved of us Jane, we will help you any way we
can. We will just have to chain you up at night so you can feel safe to
rest. I don’t know what else we can do.

Jane said, “Jill, tell me more about Susan—”

As I walk out I find myself ambushed by the black court.

There’s about 2 dozen maybe more. There aren’t any people around now so
I can let rip so not so bad. They spread out directly in front of me and
about 3 walk out to face me closer than the rest. One speaks.

“The three of us are the elders of this district. You have killed a
dozen of our brethren. You, a mere mortal, have embarrassed us in front
of our court and all vampires. You have invited destruction to us and
have dishonored us, you who are no more than food. You foolish pathetic
creature did you think we would let you live after such insolence? You
are going to wish you died on the roof for now your death will be slow
and quite painful I assure you.”

I spread my stance to get ready for what’s coming, “OK, come give me a
little. Don’t be shy.”

One of the other elders shouts, “More insolence! Take her down! Don’t
kill her I want her alive to play with later!”

Holy shit did they ever send in the troops! Not a couple dozen, many
dozen. If I do manage to clear out all these vamps would it set me up
for more? I want to get my life back not get into the superhero market
battling super-villains the rest of my days. He wants me captured so
i’ll get captured and break away. Easiest thing. What happens next time
though? They aren’t going to forget and that’s what i want most.

So without a better plan i decided to just go with just chilling at the
bottom of a football style pileup and getting escorted back to the day
spa they offered me.

Trouble was i didn’t like how they were trying to feast on me anyway. It
hurt real bad and i was getting really pissed. I noticed for lack of a
better word i was smoking. Light black smoke was drifting off my body
and i was getting real hungry. One of the vampires broke through my
flesh mask and stood up quick, “My lord, we have a big problem here!”

The elder that he addressed said, “what the hell kind of problem could
you have?”

Another vampire broke through and screamed, “She’s red court!”

“What! Impossible! The red court is dead! Kill her! Kill her! Do not let
the red court return!”

Oh i lost it. I snapped. These guys are a liability now i need to wipe
them out before I’m revealed! There were a dozen on me i burst straight
up and some kind of speed do i have. I threw a fist before they moved
and 4 slammed into a wall. Now the strangest thing happened. The smoke
edged toward the 4 and a thick oily smoke rose from them. It flowed into
me and they had what looked like a grand maul seizures, then they were
still. Then they turned to dust. I turned to face the remaining vampires
and my fangs were dripping what was in appearance hot tar, that same
colour and consistency.

The elders hit the dirt in prostration so fast i thought they might have
eaten gravel. “Spare us oh great mother, queen and empress we did not
know have mercy on us!” The other vampires looked at each other in
confusion then prostrated in the same way. Oh shit, what did i just do.
Can i get out of this? I cant kill them now, as much as i hate vampires
i cant hurt any being if it is begging mercy. Not like in the red court
days. I would take off a vamps head even as it wept. They were incapable
of feeling. I seen the atrocity and I know. I don’t think they will take
it back because I have no idea what tipped them off. Granted what my
instinct did was weird but I would hardly describe it as something
majestic. Oh this is not good, not good at all. I’ll play dumb.

“excuse me?”

“you are the long awaited great mother, the one prophesied to lead the
vampire courts to world domination! You are her. You are the devourer of
souls. We are your servants great one, we are your children oh great
mother lead us and guide us.”

Sounds like I’m Susan the Christ of the left hand path. Perhaps I should
speak parables. I can’t bring them back to the rectory I don’t think.
Their skin is falling off i’ll call them lepers. Hah, no. I don’t really
want to go to their lair it would be horrible, bodies piled around
people mind controlled and chained to be used for food i cant handle it.
I need time to figure out what to do.

“meet me at the church cemetery 3 blocks west, in two days. Once it’s
dark. We will talk then. I have important tasks to perform.”

“yes my queen it will be so”

I had another vision of Jane, I see her on top of a man a second away
from making a kill. Her venom is dripping on him and he is writhing in
ecstacy. A loud blast from a shotgun and another man drags him away.
Jane is thrown 10 feet away with a hole in her chest. She regenerates in
a few seconds and I feel the overwhelming hunger. She runs into a
patient tent and grabs a fresh test vial. The nurse said, “Hey where you
going with that?” and Jane flew out the other door into the forest
cracking open the vial, drinking the contents, still running.

This is bad. There’s deathstone waiting for me in this. I’m becoming
known for being what I do not know. I wonder how bad it is that other
creatures should know me better than I know myself. Are they even right?
Maybe there will be death awaiting me when they realize I’m not their
queen. I accept that what I did by instinct back there was something
altogether new, but to call me queen it’s not like mountains crumble
before my will. The greatest elders of the red court were gods by right
and yet they were certainly not considered kings or queens. If that is
so what would a true monarch of the vampire courts be like I wonder.
Even the monarch of a single court would be strong. As strong or greater
than any current leader but to rule all the courts, it’s scary. I can
safely say, it ain’t me. I don’t have that kind of juice, I just don’t,
no matter what Spook may say.

The word of the day is survive. They expect a queen, and they are not
beyond killing another vampire, especially not one they think is a red
court. From what I seen if I don’t carry myself as the queen they would
have me be they would consider me a red, then death will come swiftly.

So if they expect a queen, maybe I’ll give a speech on something. A
feast perhaps, many mortals gathered for a decadent meal. I can’t
control what happens I wish I could. I could abstain perhaps.

Well, tomorrow I start the network redirect to check for useful E-Mail
and gather the papers and photos. I’ll also start my report. What I have
now is damning enough alone but there is no such thing as too much
evidence.

I start the redirect of network traffic in the morning. I’ll leave it
going for at least a week and grab Wireshark and that book i got for it
and run the data capture through a sieve to find juicy E-Mails.

I talk to father about the event and he recommends considering we both
hate vampires but if a group of them look up to you in such a way then
godless or not you could influence them in ways combat can’t. He said
try, the worst thing I could do is fail then I’m just back to not being
an influence having lost nothing for trying. Hell that seems ok to me.
If only he were right.

I strip cleaned my glock and did that laying down thing again. I like
it. Its very comfy. I wish I had deathstone to load it with. Sure there
are specialty ammunitions like silver that can work with some
supnaturals but nothing as universal and sure as deathstone. Don’t leave
home without it.

I feel like this might be an important story for me, so I created an
E-Mail address and a pen name. I also drew up a binding agreement so
that the arcane has to publish my pen name and contact in the article so
I can get feedback on this one. I have material of a high calibre in it
and I can learn a lot about writing this kind of story in the future. I
mean this is like the pelican brief of paranormal articles. The best
i’ve done to date i think and the electronic surveillance is just
started.

I see a vision of Jane again, walking back into the encampment. Her
hunger is still barely manageable. People are talking about the assault,
the victims symptoms and lack of the body of the attacker. People are
thinking the red court might not be as dead as they thought. She enters
her research tent and begins work.

Time does fly. I head over to the cemetery a bit early and sit on a tree
stump. Best seat in the house. Over the course of an hour after sunset
they begin to arrive.

As I see it, I’ll play the queen and get out fast. I won’t have to be
here in San Jose long, then I can head back fast, they will soon forget
about me and I won’t make a spectacle of myself I don’t want to be
remembered by these damned creatures. Besides there were only maybe two
or three dozen of them. Yeah sure that’s quite a lot but maybe they
won’t all show up. Maybe there’ll be three show up and shoot the shit I
give them some sort of chinese cookie wisdom and I’m gone.

Five, then ten, fucking fifty, then fifty times fifty. The cemetary is
crawling with black court. I had no idea there were this many black
court in all the planet. They were packed in the cemetary and poured out
into the street throwing any nearby mortals into catatonia to ensure
they will have no memory of the event. Many of the catatonic were drawn
out like a prepared feast and the gore was profound. The smell of
putrefied flesh was overwhelming. It was like that loaves and fishes
story in the bible they just kept coming. Verily verily i say unto thee
the neighbourhood was alive with undead.

“tell us what we must do most glorious queen.”

a mass wave of prostration followed, visually appearing like a domino
effect, “hail to our great mother, our philosopher queen!”

Followed by a thundering “hail! Hail! Hail!”

Then they disappeared into a non-corporeal state.

They will hopefully come to understanding because with a single short
speech i saved innumerable human lives and hopefully put an end to all
the people in chains or tortured currently by these monsters. As I was
walking away I missed Maggie. The talking of the great mother thing just
made my heart bleed, I want to be with my human first-born baby. I
turned back to the cemetery for no particular reason and my vampire
vision went up. I could see all the vampires talking in their
non-corporeal forms that humans can’t see. I could hear the quiet
telepathic chatter they were making. I just stood there a few minutes in
awe of what i hope to be accomplishing from within this vampire society
to help people. Help them from within the ranks of the oppressor. My
mind started wandering through my fight and struggles against the red
court for all that time, the hopeless frustration of what seemed so
often to be a hopeless battle against hopeless odds. Like trying to bail
out the ocean with a spoon. Now having been made a vampire if i could
call it that I am looking at the best chance to finally make things
right. Something i could never do before. Maybe even use my work to
release them of this accursed hunger.\

Then I felt something unexpected. Horribly shocking.\

I felt love.\

Not pity, not sympathy or empathy. No, a burning love ignited in me like
a mother to her children. I’m falling in love with these wretched
creatures very quickly and very powerfully after interacting with them
as their great mother. Almost like they had tempted me to do something
only to have triggered the catalyst to my own inner transformation into
their true mother without my warning. I remember all the horrors i’ve
seen these creatures do but all i can think now is to embrace them and
heal the twisted nature that commands them to do such horrible acts. I
want them to be free to choose how they live and how they hunt. I see
them and they have become beautiful to me. Oh fuck me gently that is
just so wrong on so many levels.

As I was about to turn away three figures appeared from out of the
cemetary. A thick mist came and one by one they emerged. The first was a
gentleman with translucent hair and pure white eyes. Nothing else
special about him just an ordinary bloke. He spoke and said that his
name is Eurynomous. He introduced his two friends the first had a cloak
and cowl that made him look like the grim reaper minus the scythe. The
cloak covered every part of him. Eurynomous stated this gentleman’s name
is Balberith. The last gentleman to emerge, if you could call him a
gentleman by appearance was named Babeal. He was semi-corporeal, with a
long flowing robe and his hands were folded together in front of him
covered completely by the loose and ample sleeves.

Eurynomous said, “This seemed to be a good opportunity to introduce
ourselves. I believe you have already met our brother Leviathan. He is
dæmon of water, as I am dæmon of death. My brother Balberith is the
dæmon of dying and Babeal is dæmon of graves. Our being has intimacy
with yours so I found it imperative that we meet.”

I went into a panic. I was able to keep my composure despite feeling
like I was having a heart attack. I am not in pleasant company.

I said, “So I met death today. Literally. A person just can’t make that
stuff up without having their sanity questioned.”

He said, “Ha! Agreed. We owe you a lot Susan, you ended so much pain and
bloodshed.”

I said, “So says dæmon of death? I thought you would desire as much
death as you could.”

He said, “No. I desire a good death at the appointed time. I desire a
balance of the cycle of life and bear sorrow for what took place. I bear
sorrow deep in my heart for those who have died. I am part of the life
cycle. I try to comfort both the living and the dead upon the death of a
being. I help with the transition along with Balberith. Balberith is a
companion of the dying and counsel to those who love them. He and I take
them gently into the final journey. Babeal watches over the resting
place of those who have taken that road. As he says watching over the
vehicle of earthly gods from when they roamed this earth. It means a lot
to him, the greatest honour one could have. I certainly am humbled over
his reverent dedication. Sadly we are the anthropomorphic
personification of what we represent, we need to act through the gods
who tap our power or mortals that meditate on us humbly”

I said, “Interesting. I never really looked at it that way.”

He said, “It’s the cycle of life, as they say to all things there is a
season. We are going to part from you now. I just want to tell you that
we are staying close to you as you learn and grow in your new powers. We
will help keep you from danger, for as you will soon find out there is
not any right of dæmon to be manifest in the physical world. It’s far
too dangerous. Remember it’s your destiny to be manifest here Susan, it
is prophesy fulfilled, try not to be afraid.”

They turned and reentered the mist at the cemetary gate. I think
although I don’t entirely understand what they said that it will become
important to know I have dæmon brothers looking out for me, and that I’m
doing what I’m destined to in being here. How is it dangerous to be in
the physical world? I was born here and have not known any other.

One small thing he said, which may be nothing. He said there is no place
for dæmon to be manifest in the physical world. Then he tells me it’s my
destiny to be manifest here. He seems to be insinuating I am dæmon as
well. Coupled with what spook has told me and what they have said it
would mean I am the anthropomorphic personification of something. I
dismissed it though, there is no way. I’m sure it was just a mistake in
the wording of what he said. I think somehow he feels close to me and
responsible for what I am going through right now. He is a very powerful
being so maybe it has to do either with my death or the death of others.
I’m thinking if others know the power I seem to possess someone is going
to take me down. Maybe someone who seen me here tonight at the cemetary.
I think that’s it. This is my life though and I control my destiny, I’ll
be careful about using my powers from now on. I’ll stay out of trouble
and off the radar of dangerous power hungry beings who might feel
threatened and attempt to take my life. OK so I’m going back to the
rectory real quiet like. Every sense of mine was tuned all around me. I
didn’t know where or when danger is going to find me. Vampires can’t be
trusted. I just threatened someones plans to have power over this black
court. I’m as good as dead now.

I arrive back at the rectory to see a complete skeleton standing beside
the door. I think I must have jumped 10 feet. My talons were out and I
was ready for battle. The skeleton said, “Hello, I am He Who Dances With
Wind. Have mercy on your humble servant my queen” He prostrates. I bid
him rise again. I’m still not feeling safe.

That shit is so embarrassing. “Are you a skeleton?”

“I am a black court vampire”

Suddenly I had trouble breathing. I clacked my talons.

“but you are no more than a skeleton”

“I am the most elder of the court. I have walked this earth from before
the reckoning of time. Before civilization came upon the earth. Even
upon all these years spoken record heralded your coming. I never thought
I would see the day I would stand before you.”

I had unfurled my wings ready to take to the air but then I realized
anyone that would intend me harm wouldn’t show up looking this way and
certainly wouldn’t speak of himself as being so ancient. These creatures
are quite smart, until tonight I thought few of them were left from the
slaughter many years ago. Speaking and appearing as he did he would know
it would put me ready for battle. I unfurled my wings and retracted my
talons, although I am not going to be completely at ease with this
creature.

I said, “So you are what would be called an ancient vampire then.”

I look at the door, then back to him, what the hell. Father has heard
worse from me I’m sure he wont mind seeing worse also.

“Are you able to enter a holy place? Would you be hurt?”

“Susan I’ll be fine.”

“How did you know my name? Never mind, ancient vampire, needn’t ask
more. Please come in.”

We sit at the kitchen table to parley.

Father Gomez came in and fell flat on his ass.

He Who Dances With Wind stood and bowed low to father, “I am sorry to
have startled you most honourable shaman, i am He Who Dances With Wind.
I am the most ancient of vampires at your service oh king.”

Father rose, and coughed, “You presume i am a priest king like
Melchizedek high priest and king. I am no shaman but the humble priest
of the most high god. Um, my dear?”, he raises an eyebrow.

“he is very polite i didn’t think you would mind.”

Father makes a face-palm. Taking the seat across from us at the table he
looks to He Who Dances With Wind and rubs his chin. We talked until
morning and father agreed to allow he who dances with wind to stay if he
can do penance by staying in the crypt to clean and maintain the tombs.
He agreed.

It continued that way and he would come up and father was fascinated
with his experience and understanding. He stopped feeding millennia ago,
he was tired of it. He left to become a hermit. And a legend of the
vampires in the north east of the US. Only the elders would dare
approach him and never did except on rare occasions.

I gathered the email transactions at the end of the week and found some
rather juicy stuff. In particular the messages to and from the main
office. If they actually used gpg for their confidential email I
wouldn’t have been able to have snatched what I did. The story is done
and sent.

My wise man who came from afar, He Who Dances With Wind, is going home.
This time he is being granted permission by Rome to remain as a hermit
on land governed by Rome.

The native americans of new york state, the highest elders specifically,
also became aware of him and he spends much more time sharing lodge on
reservations sharing knowledge lost long ago of the history of his
people which now is the history of all native people. Last i heard him
say he is happier than he has been in a long time. Which to me means a
very very long time.

I see a vision of Jane. The man from before that fired a shotgun into
her is threatening her saying he knows what she is. I feel the hunger
she has, and at that moment the fear that assaults her from being
discovered caused her to lose control. She moved on the man and took him
down hard and fast. Blood was everywhere. The body was badly torn. I
felt the familiar ecstatic pain of final transformation begin in her.
She runs as fast as she can into the forest and she is torn apart from
the inside by the final change. Fear has changed into sheer terror
because like any of us she has seen this before in other people. They
were not themselves anymore. They were, something, else.

I need to get to her now before it’s too late.

More to come...

Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material. Downstream recipients. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed
Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights
under the terms and conditions of this Public License. Additional offer
from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted
Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the
conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as
permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the
Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor
waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the
Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under
any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In
all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect
such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
must: retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
designated); a copyright notice; a notice that refers to this Public
License; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; a URI or
hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
of any previous modifications; and indicate the Licensed Material is
licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI
or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in
Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to
a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the
Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section
3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
Material You produce, the following conditions also apply. The Adapter’s
License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same
License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter’s
License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable
manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
Adapted Material. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights
granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of
the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis
Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis
Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
including for purposes of Section 3(b); and You must comply with the
conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of
the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,
or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of
warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not
apply to You. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be
liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or
damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation
is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive
termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any
arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License. To the extent possible, if any
provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be
automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it
enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the
remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition of this Public
License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless
expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of,
any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You,
including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
