\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{C}lang! I look up and Bones had swung his rifle in the path of the katana as it came down, tears flowing in Jamar's eyes.

Bones said, ``Goddammit Sarg, I hearby relieve you of duty Sargeant Dwight Miller on cause of madness. Jamar you will take leadership of this team until I deem Sargeant Miller to be fit for duty again.''

Sarg said, ``You have got to be kidding, don't fucking joke Bones I ain't in the mood and there's an enemy among us. Jamar get it done.''

Jamar said, ``No Sarg, he is our medic and he has the authority. You are acting mad right now and you need to get your squirrels out.''

Sarg said, ``What a goddamn clusterfuck, you people have a goddamned screw loose she must have poisoned the rations, or you all got enthralled! Bloody hell that's it you all are going down.'' He pulled forward his rifle and clicked off the safety, ``for the fellowship, for justice!''

I didn't know if I could do it but I know the reds could hypnotize by looking into a humans eyes, control them from afar. I quickly raised my eyes to meet Sarg. Instinctively reacting to my intent the black vampire eyes unveiled themselves as my third eyelid covered over my eyes and I could see the world again as no human could. The vitality of my human companions was evident, the health of their bodies and the vision of their blood flowing through them. Their psychic aura presented itself revealing more about them than they knew about themselves if I chose to observe them intently but there was no time and no reason for doing it. My eyes drilled into Sarg's and I pierced his psyche; I pierced that burning red aura that revealed without doubt the sheer anger he was feeling; I pierced the madness that had surrounded him and consumed him. His thoughts lay before me at my mercy, to be twisted by my will but this I refuse to do. I raised my hand and blew a cool breeze from my lips as if I was blowing a kiss and moulded it into a psychic wind that washed over Sarg extinguishing the fire and madness that was consuming him. I could see him fall limp but his fire once again began to grow. Bones grabbed his rifle and threw it while Jamar covered him with his own rifle. 

I'm trying to fall back into a fully human form but it's not happening. I never did anything like that before and I have no experience that would allow me to know how to return. I see the ice surrounding Sarg, the cone of ice formed on the ground from me to him like some kind of telltale sign that neuromantic power was just unleashed. It's inevitable, I'm trying to hold back the ocean as I continue my change into another form. I'm clenching my jaw, I'm holding on for now but not much longer.

Bones said, ``I swore to you that I would keep your confidence Sarg but I will not do so in the face of murder. You have never resolved your pain from the loss of your wife we both know that and I do believe we both knew it would someday cause you to make mistakes. I hoped that it would not cause too much trouble or put anyone in danger but this lunacy is far and above what I thought. I take the blame for that you should never have had a position of power in this fellowship. I pray to God above may he have mercy on my soul for making such a grievous error as this. Now you look at that woman and look real close, who do you see? Who do you see in her you fool?''

Sarg looked at me, wrung his hands and rolled his head. He held his hand to his chin and then I seen his eyes start to grow. His face grew white. He started to shake and turned to the side to vomit into a bush. Sarg said, ``My God, Jennifer! She looks exactly like Jennifer!''

Bones said, ``That's right fool. Your wife. You're trying to bring peace to your wife. Is this your wife Sarg? If it is I weep for you man but I do believe she said her name was Susan did she not?''

Sarg said, ``She isn't Jennifer. She looks like her but I knew Jennifer, her likes, her dislikes, the way she could make me laugh and inspire me every day. My love knew her and still knows her and no this is not Jennifer; this is not my beloved Jennifer.'' Sarg was on his knees now facing me, with his head hung low to the ground he wept.

Bones let out a long whistle and shook his head as he turned towards me. Jamar in his new command declared, ``I'll watch him doc, take a look at Susan she looks like shes trying to shit a brick.''

I was clenching my teeth and now I'm clenching my whole face. I'm feeling dizzy from the effort and sweat is pouring off me. I have tightly clenched fists; my body is trembling. Jamar gave a very fair description. I'm desperately holding off the change.

Bones looked at me and said, ``What is it about today, ain't no full moon that I know. Oh Sarg, goddamit man, what did you do to this poor woman in your mad display. Susan what is going on with you?''

I looked at Bones and said, ``The effort I put in helping Sarg, I triggered something. I'm undergoing some sort of change. I've been holding on the best I can; I can't do it forever. I'm scared Bones. I can't know what this change will be and it scares me.''

Bones looked to Jamar who was close enough to hear me out. Bones said to Jamar, ``OK call it boss.''

Jamar said, ``Right. Bones and Injun take position twenty feet equidistant from Susan. Sarg, we'll cover the civilians.''

Jack said, ``Damn straight. 'bout time you took notice of us over here. We'll grab rifles as well to support you guys.''

Bones said, ``Good. Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the hounds of hell, Susan let yourself go.''

I let go. There was nothing for a moment then I felt a trembling from deep within me. Then like a distant explosion the fire and mania poured through me and seemingly out of every pore. It pulled me into the air; I hovered; my wings broke free from my back and my clothes tore and fell to the ground. I grew to a height of ten feet tall; my body flowed into supermodel proportions; my hair fell out in wild abandon and my feet elongated to give a hint of goat-like limbs. My calves grew sleek, sexy and furry. My foot talons extended to a form identical to hooves. My body was firm and gorgeous like the greek goddess Aphrodite. The men surrounding me left a lake of drool fit to fish in. I stretched my wings slightly. Flap-flap, flap\dots flap. I descended to the ground landing on my pseudo-hooves. The sheer power of my awareness was overwhelming. I lowered myself down to one knee and covered my head in my arms to try to block out stimuli. It was too much for me to process and it took a few moments for me to block it all out. I looked up again, now holding back the torrent of sensations; I am in fear of cracks appearing in that dam I erected; I rest precariously on nothing but my own strength to keep me sane.

Sarg was getting his senses back slowly, enough to say, ``That ain't no red. She be a greek god maybe or some fallen angel but she ain't be no red by God.''

I slowly looked myself over. I grabbed a mirror and seen myself dark with midnight hair flowing like in a breeze yet on this day when the air is still. I've never seen anything like this. I look out over my friends to behold a sea of thousand mile stares, their psyches overwhelmed. I see Spook, but not in this physical world. My eyes perceive an infinity of realities, all time, all places, all things and spirits are within my knowing and all these and more I have blocked out but I see him in a place that is not of this physical plane. Oh yes his body is here but I see that he has been stolen from us and imprisoned in a dark horror of his own creation. Yet in my being, as I am, I know this place to be in my reach; and it is mine to travel; it is my duty to seek him and to find him; it is my duty to bring him home.

I am burdened by miraculous purpose and focus on Spook. I lift myself up on these wings of glory and follow a mysterious path. I flew not in any of the directions of a compass, nor up or down. Into a foreign and twisted reality I flew and the world faded like a thick cloud coming over the sun; it faded like those same clouds passing into twilight; it faded from twilight to night, then from night to the darkness of a cavern in the midst of the earth. Yet once consumed by this new reality I find it is vast, truly endless. My eyes adjust and all I can see here is shades of grey. It appears as if everything here was once alive but has long since become dead. Not even decay has survived as everything has become simply dust, time has had no power to consume that which has been and death has become immortal in all that I see. The burden on my heart is profound, the pain of the descent of oblivion has settled on me. I am raging against the psychological effect of this corrupt and dark environment assaulted by guilt, horror, terror, hopelessness. This place seems to attack me, it wishes to assimilate me into this horrible death that I see before me. I must reach Spook, and quickly, my new form and the burden of this place will soon be too much. I cannot let myself be consumed.

I began walking to where I knew Spook was. I don't know how it is that I knew, I just knew where he will be. Leafless trees and grass still in it's perfect shape but falling to dust as I walk on it with with my hooves. After about a mile I noticed the fur on my calves and some of my skin was turning black. The damned dust is necrotizing my flesh. I leap far into the air and thrust out my wings. I'm going to try to fly there. I'm going to exhaust myself before I get anywhere near Spook. I try extending my wings out as far as I can. I find I can lay out a wingspan of fifty feet and glide like an eagle. Perhaps I will get there ok after all. The landscape below passes quickly but not quickly enough Spook is far away indeed. Far beyond the horizon.
