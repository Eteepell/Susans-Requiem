\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{C}lang! I look up and Bones had swung his rifle in the path of the katana as it came down, tears flowing in Jamar's eyes.

Bones said, ``Goddammit Sarg, I hearby relieve you of duty Sargeant Dwight Miller on cause of madness. Jamar you will take leadership of this team until I deem Sargeant Miller to be fit for duty again.''

Sarg said, ``You have got to be kidding, don't fucking joke Bones I ain't in the mood and there's an enemy among us. Jamar get it done.''

Jamar said, ``No Sarg, he is our medic and he has the authority. You are acting mad right now and you need to get your squirrels out.''

Sarg said, ``What a goddamn clusterfuck, you people have a goddamned screw loose she must have poisoned the rations, or you all got enthralled! Bloody hell that's it you all are going down.'' He pulled forward his rifle and clicked off the safety, ``for the fellowship, for justice!''

I didn't know if I could do it but I know the reds could hypnotize by looking into a humans eyes, control them from afar. I quickly raised my eyes to meet Sarg. Instinctively reacting to my intent the black vampire eyes unveiled themselves as my third eyelid covered over my eyes and I could see the world again as no human could. The vitality of my human companions was evident, the health of their bodies and the vision of their blood flowing through them. Their psychic aura presented itself revealing more about them than they knew about themselves if I chose to observe them intently but there was no time and no reason for doing it. My eyes drilled into Sarg's and I pierced his psyche; I pierced that burning red aura that revealed without doubt the sheer anger he was feeling; I pierced the madness that had surrounded him and consumed him. His thoughts lay before me at my mercy, to be twisted by my will but this I refuse to do. I raised my hand and blew a cool breeze from my lips as if I was blowing a kiss and moulded it into a psychic wind that washed over Sarg extinguishing the fire and madness that was consuming him. I could see him fall limp but his fire once again began to grow. Bones grabbed his rifle and threw it while Jamar covered him with his own rifle. 

I'm trying to fall back into a fully human form but it's not happening. I never did anything like that before and I have no experience that would allow me to know how to return. I see the ice surrounding Sarg, the cone of ice formed on the ground from me to him like some kind of telltale sign that neuromantic power was just unleashed. It's inevitable, I'm trying to hold back the ocean as I continue my change into another form. I'm clenching my jaw, I'm holding on for now but not much longer.

Bones said, ``I swore to you that I would keep your confidence Sarg but I will not do so in the face of murder. You have never resolved your pain from the loss of your wife we both know that and I do believe we both knew it would someday cause you to make mistakes. I hoped that it would not cause too much trouble or put anyone in danger but this lunacy is far and above what I thought. I take the blame for that you should never have had a position of power in this fellowship. I pray to God above may he have mercy on my soul for making such a grievous error as this. Now you look at that woman and look real close, who do you see? Who do you see in her you fool?''

Sarg looked at me, wrung his hands and rolled his head. He held his hand to his chin and then I seen his eyes start to grow. His face grew white. He started to shake and turned to the side to vomit into a bush. Sarg said, ``My God, Jennifer! She looks exactly like Jennifer!''

Bones said, ``That's right fool. Your wife. You're trying to bring peace to your wife. Is this your wife Sarg? If it is I weep for you man but I do believe she said her name was Susan did she not?''

Sarg said, ``She isn't Jennifer. She looks like her but I knew Jennifer, her likes, her dislikes, the way she could make me laugh and inspire me every day. My love knew her and still knows her and no this is not Jennifer; this is not my beloved Jennifer.'' Sarg was on his knees now facing me, with his head hung low to the ground he wept.

Bones let out a long whistle and shook his head as he turned towards me. Jamar in his new command declared, ``I'll watch him doc, take a look at Susan she looks like shes trying to shit a brick.''

I was clenching my teeth and now I'm clenching my whole face. I'm feeling dizzy from the effort and sweat is pouring off me. I have tightly clenched fists; my body is trembling. Jamar gave a very fair description. I'm desperately holding off the change.

Bones looked at me and said, ``What is it about today, ain't no full moon that I know. Oh Sarg, goddamit man, what did you do to this poor woman in your mad display. Susan what is going on with you?''

I looked at Bones and said, ``The effort I put in helping Sarg, I triggered something. I'm undergoing some sort of change. I've been holding it off the best I can but I cant do it forever. I'm scared Bones. I haven't changed into anything out of my own control yet, nothing evil or corrupted, but I can't know what this change will be and it scares me.''

Bones looked to Jamar who was close enough to hear me out. Bones said to Jamar, ``OK call it boy.''

Jamar said, ``Right. Bones, Injun take position twenty feet equidistant from Susan and Sarg to cover both I going to the civilians to cover them.''

Jack said, ``Damn straight. 'bout time you took notice of us over here. We'll grab rifles as well to support you guys.''

Bones said, ``Good. Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the hounds of hell, Susan let go.''

I let go. There was nothing for a moment then I felt a trembling from deep within me. Then like a distant explosion the fire and mania poured through me and seemingly out of every pour. I was pulled to hover in the air, my wings broke free from my back and my clothes slipped to the ground. I grew to a height of ten feet tall and my body flowed out to match proportion in an absolutely perfect manner My hair fell out in wild abandon and my feet elongated to give a hint of goatlike limbs. My calves grew out hair the color of my head and of the same texture. My foot talons extended to a form identical to hooves. My body was firm and gorgeous like a greek God. The men surrounding me left a lake of drool fit to fish in. Flapflap, flap\dots flap. I descended by my wings to the ground landing on my pseudo-hooves. The sheer power of my awareness was overwhelming. It was too much for me to process and it took me a few moments for me to block it all out.

Sarg was getting his senses back slowly, enough to say, ``That ain't no red. She be a greek god maybe or some fallen angel but she ain't be no red by God.''
