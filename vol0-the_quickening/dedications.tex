%\section{Dedication to Queen Lilith}
%	{
%
		%Bear with me here, \textit{Queen Lilith is the actual god and queen of vampires}. The real one, insofar as there could be.
		%	
		%I've done some research as I went along, what writer doesn't. I was creatively inspired to write about what happened to Susan on the alter of \chichenitza*. How she stood against the odds and will change the world for the better. The story of a hero who just happens to be a vampire physically. Somebody decent, with a dangerous side. I started it two or three months ago.
		%
		%I've avoided looking too much into vampire lore. The reason being I believed it would be horrible, mean and nasty. Either in the horror sense or in the campy sense.
		%
		%That isn't what I wanted to show in Susan. Neither maniacal nor glittery. I wanted to break the mold of vampire novels and \textit{not write a vampire novel.} I would write about an antihero trying to make a positive difference in the world without brooding a lot. That's gotten very annoying with other protagonists over the years. 
		%
		%I wanted to show strength, confidence, determination, responsibility, and someone protective and nurturing. A female hero that stands alone. A female hero that can be truly intimidating, and lay down some serious kick ass when it needs to be done.

		%About a month ago or a little longer I had a rather forgettable experience in seeing a praying mantis under a case I had put down. I had never seen a praying mantis before that I can remember, I thought it was pretty cool. How it got there was a mystery there was nothing but concrete floor ten feet around me. I should think I would have seen it, but who knows. I felt bad for the little creature so I picked it up. It wrapped it's arms around my finger and squeezed, snuggling it's head against my finger. I thought that was very odd, but not having been around the creatures I presumed it was frightened and that's just what they did to stop from falling. I was honestly afraid it would bite me but it never did. I let it go into a bush to the side of the concrete platform.
		%
		%Something that day on a webpage had a passing mention of Lilith and Lamashtu. The mention of the praying mantis as the sacred animal grabbed my attention immediately. I read her biography in response. There was Lilith, so much like Susan as I had already written her.
		%
		%I'll write more on this amazing lady in an appendix after the story.
