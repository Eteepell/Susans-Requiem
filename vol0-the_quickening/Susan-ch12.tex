\lettrine[lines=2,lraise=0]{I}\space leapt onto the chopper when it arrived.

I said, ``Hey bud, change of mission, I need you to get me somewhere.''

He said, ``Yeah, back to base, that's my orders. We need all teams home a red court vamp just made a kill on our base!''

I said, ``Well goddamn it, ain't that the shit. You're still getting me where I'm asking.''

He said, ``Look soldier, I have my orders and I ain't got radioed no changes. You're going back to base.''

I said, ``What if I said I was holding you by gunpoint, would that change your orders?''

He said, ``You're not holding no weapon at me.''

I said, ``Do you want me to?''

He said, ``Jesus, what's the deal miss?''

I said, ``There's a soldier out there and she's in real bad trouble. I gotta find her and help her get herself home.''

He said, ``Well that is my orders, to get everyone back to base. Besides I never leave a soldier on the field.''

I said, ``Thanks man.''

He said, ``Stay on mission.''


I seen a vision of Jane, she is by a stream and she has changed. Her body anyway. Her skin is black, muscular and big. Something different there. She is as terrified as ever. I hear her whisper to me. She wants help. I do what I can to send her feelings of comfort and of my impending arrival. She seems to pick up on it and calms down a little.

I'm trying hard to use my psychic connection to Jane to find her location. I'm not good yet on how it works but I did find the stream and got chopper boy to follow it until I had some really strong sensations.

I said, ``This is the spot man, I'm gonna get off here.''

He said, ``Lady there isn't anywhere to land and we got no chutes. What are you gonna do tuck and roll?''

I said, ``Not your problem I got this.''

I did some shapeshifting on the last mission, I'm feeling rather confident on changing to and from trueform now. If not well I'm saving someones life so if I die trying there is honor in it.

I leapt from the chopper right into true form. Even as I passed doors of the huey. Chopper boy was praising God but getting the words mixed up.

My senses got stronger as I was able to fly on my own. I could feel her close. I heard her in my thoughts.

Jane said, ``Susan, is that you up there?''

I said, ``I can feel you I think. I hope. I want to say yes.''

I heard a disturbance in the forest below, and through the leaves I seen what looked like an honest to hell demon fly out. It had leathery bat wings, barbed tail, ungulate legs. It was definately Jane but the changes were definately significant. Looks like she is about 10 feet tall like me, with a vulgar display of muscle. Her skin is black like a red court but her whole body is rippling with fire. What might be a kind of bat ears look variably either batman ears or demons horns swept back.

We flew hard toward each other, and embraced in mid air. Then together we flew hugging the treetops a mile and descended to the stream again. We're fellowship, it's all about staying hidden. Chopper boy could bring the cavalry after us if he knew where we actually were.

I said, ``You seem different. I take it you couldn't stick to your diet?''

She said, ``It seemed sometimes you were there with me, I'm not sure how. A couple times I felt you presence, reassurance, in a real way. Were you really there?''

I said, ``I would get visions of you, like I was you. So maybe, but not intentionally you didn't want me around.''

She said, ``I was mad. I'm a bit of a hot head even when I try not to be. I got over it. Especially when I seen I healed a good quarter of the thousands of sick people under my care. I'm sorry, you were right.''

I said, ``I seen them, you showed me. I heard your apology, you were successful in getting it to me. There's a lot of healing that has to be done for people. We may not bear the burden of guilt but we do bear a certain burden of making it right. Even after this I think you will find there is a need for you as you are in this world. You're a healer, be a healer.''

She said, ``Then of course eternal life. I was actually looking forward to a good death and living within the frame of my generation. I'll lose over and over endlessly.''

I said, ``Eternal life on earth is a lie. Vampires were supposed to be immmortal but we seen in our own time the death of an entire court of vampires, all killed in an instant. Everything changed.''

She said, ``I hate changes.''

I said, ``Who doesn't.''

She said, ``So how do we eat then?''

I looked her up and down, then I said, ``I think you already know girl.''

She said, ``No no I mean, the reds had thralls to feed from. I hate the practise with a passion they left such horror behind.''

I said, ``Remember it took a vampire to heal the harm done by other vampires. I'll help you understand your dietary concerns in the mean time just be careful who you eat you don't know where they've been.''

She said, ``Christ.''

She started chuckling, then I said, ``See? I finally broke through. Have a laugh, and feel a little better. I'll help you get back on your feet doc.''
