Susan's Requiem Series

Welcome to my first attempt at writing anything. Like. Ever.
This first book is written using LaTeX. The application is available for, well, everything from phones to tablets to computers usually for free.

See the README in the source for more info.

This book is written using LaTeX. It's all you need to get started working on the book.
The application is available for, well, everything from phones to tablets to computers usually for free.

What you can and can't do is in the license, see `LICENSE' for a layman's version.

example LaTeX apps:

windows					MiKTeX
Linux/UNIX				TeXstudio
android					TeXPortal + any text editor
iPhone/iPad				just shy of $15 - Texpad, TeXWriter.
iMac					MacTeX

Yes you can copy everything into word. It's all text documents. It would also be heresy and might put you at risk of being burned at the stake for being in league with the devil whose name is Microsoft. Just sayin'.
