Susan's Requiem

Welcome to my first attempt at writing anything. Like. Ever.
This book is written using LaTeX. The application is available for, well, everything from phones to tablets to computers usually for free.
What you can and can't do is in the license, see `LICENSE' in the volume 0 source for a layman's version.
More details are in the README within the volume 0 source.

I'll be putting together git sorcerous incantations so that us dummies know how to make it work. Copy and paste.
