         AN ENOCHIAN FONT FROM THE NU ISIS WORKING GROUP

nienrg__.ttf  NI Enochian

This version of the Enochian script has been closely conformed to the 
final form of the letters in the Dee diaries (as reproduced by Laycock 
in _Complete Enochian Dictionary_).  Besides the 21 Enochian letters 
this font also includes Dee's "monas" symbol (on the } key).

This font may be freely redistributed and used provided that the header 
information in the font file including the line "This freeware font created 
by the Nu Isis Working Group" is left intact in any distribution.
