PDFtk Server

This program is available in linux/bsd packages or at https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/


You can attach the source for the book right into the pdf you distribute publicly. I found out about
that because the LaTex_wikibook did exactly that. I couldn't get the wikibook to compile though something was broken somewhere and I didn't have the brains or the time to find out what. Oh well.

So make a folder and put the vanilla pdf in it, and the zip of your source however you decided to make one. rename the zip file to have .txt at the end rather than .zip then open a command prompt and put in the incantation:

pdftk Main-PDFTeX.pdf attach_files *.txt output SusansReq-Vol0_ForRelease.pdf

There. To make sure put the release pdf in a folder all it's own and enter the incantation:

pdftk SusansReq-Vol0_ForRelease.pdf unpack_files

then the source should reappear in that same folder. The reader (the schmuck who chose to read your prose) would have to rename the file from a .txt back to a .zip and then just unzip it normally.

I like the idea because the creative commons license encourages modification which is damned hard without the source from which to modify. Now whether or not they care, they will have it. Coolio.
